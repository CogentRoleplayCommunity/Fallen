## World Lore

On a dead world, at the end of time, life begins once again...

![alt_text](images/Places/TheContinent.png "image_tooltip")

### The Awakening

On dead world, at the end of time, life begins once again…

This world, known as Terra, revolves around a faded and dying star. Once, it was a flourishing world teeming with consciousness and vibrant life. However, it has now become a fallen apocalyptic realm, where only malevolent creatures roam. Their ceaseless hunt driven by the hunger for the conscious life that has long since vanished into oblivion. It drifts ceaselessly through the vast expanse of space, an eternal voyage through boundless void and darkness.

![Alt text](images/Brights/Arrival of the Bright Lord.png)

However, a turning point emerged when a celestial entity, known as "the Bright Lord," descended upon Terra, accompanied by other ethereal beings referred to as the Brights or gods in various cultures. Moved by the plight of the mindless monstrosities that roamed the planet, the Bright Lord felt compassion for this lifeless realm. With a benevolent touch, he granted consciousness to those creatures that bowed before him, bestowing upon them the humanoid form akin to his own. This pivotal event came to be known as "The Awakening."

To aid the newly awakened beings in their struggle to survive and thrive in this harsh new world, each of the Brights imparted a unique aspect of themselves. These guiding principles, known as the Tenets of the Awakening, became the foundations upon which Fellkind would navigate their existence:

The Beautiful One declared, "Thou has been given the passion of flesh to spread across the land."

The Ravenous One commanded, "Thou shall indulge and consume of the world that I have granted."

The Bargainer proclaimed, "Thou shall seek prosperity in the wealth and secrets of the land."

The Bound One decreed, "Thou shall go without care for the opinions of the world."

The Faithful One vowed, "Thou shall take up arms and seek righteous vengeance upon those who have betrayed and wronged you."

The Twisting One affirmed, "Thou shall recognize the success of one's neighbor and strive to attain greatness for oneself."

And finally, the Bright Lord himself spoke, "Thou are created in the image of greatness, and shall seek strength, knowledge, and greatness to be closer to I, but shall recognize thine greatness is from within thine own labors."

Through this transformative event, a multitude of beings came into existence. The Bright Lord named these being "Fellkin", as they were of a fallen world. Despite assuming humanoid forms, Fellkind retained the ability to tap into the genetic traits inherited from their monstrous origins. Fellkind learned to harness ichor, the potential energy held in the blood of monsters and Fellkind alike. As the gifted and disciplined among them delved deeper into their newfound powers, they shaped and refined these abilities, giving birth to what is now recognized as Fellcraft.

### The First of Brightkind

With a divine touch, the Bright Lord bestowed the blessing upon the most devoted daughters of Fellkind his offspring.These were the first demi-brights or Brightkind. The Bright Lord proclaimed their rightful dominion over Terra and Fellkind to his offspring, though they would have to seize their claim through their own endeavors. Unlike their Fellkind brethren, Brightkind bore no trace of monstrous traits. They possessed the extraordinary ability to perform Miracles, akin to the Bright Lord himself. While Fellcraft adhered to the natural laws of the world, Miracles appeared to regard them as mere suggestions, perplexing scholars to this very day. Immortality coursed through the veins of Brightkin, much like their celestial progenitor, rendering them virtually impervious to permanent demise.

### Brightinism

The Bright Lord imparted his teachings upon both Fellkind and Brightkind, establishing a spiritual path known as Brightinism. Central to this belief system was the solemn warning of the Dead God, an ancient entity responsible for the forsaken state and cataclysmic demise of the previous world. The Bright Lord strictly forbade the worship of the Dead God, for it was prophesied that such reverence would summon the entity back into existence, triggering another devastating rapture. In order to guide his devoted followers, the Bright Lord bestowed upon them profound visions, serving as beacons of enlightenment and direction for his Brightinist followers.

### The Faithful One

Bathed in near endless night resulting from the fading star, the newly created inhabitants of Terra were hunted by the monsters of Terra. The Bright Lord entrusted the protection of his new creations to his most loyal companion, the bright Amon, known as the Faithful One, the bearer of the Mark of the Undying. Amon taught Fellkin and Brightkin how to defend themselves, construct weapons, and dwelled among them. Through his time among them, Amon developed a deep affection for Fellkind.

When the remaining Demon Lords of Terra began preying upon Fellkind, Amon embarked on a relentless war against them. Wielding the formidable Spear of Destiny, he waged a campaign of rampage and pursuit, extinguishing the existence of demons from Terra.

![Alt text](images/Brights/The Great Betrayer.png)

However, unsatisfied with the mere possibility of their return, Amon ventured to the very realm of the demons. There, he unleashed unyielding fury, tearing through their world with unrestrained might. Legends speak of Amon's boundless rage echoing across the demon realm for an eternity, all driven by his unwavering commitment to protecting those he cherished. The demons, recognizing his indomitable power, bestowed upon him the title of "The Demon of the West," for in time they considered him one of their own. Yet, upon his return, Amon had been forever changed.

From that moment forward, the demons never dared to set foot on Terra again, for the only thing they feared was him.

### The Great Betrayal

The motives behind Amon, the Faithful One, attempting to overthrow the Bright Lord remain shrouded in uncertainty. Some believe that he was tainted by the influence of the Dead God, while Brightinist priests often assert that it was a manifestation of the Tenets themselves and a deliberate test of the Bright Lord's will. According to tales passed down through generations, their epic clash was so cataclysmic that it fractured the moon into two distinct celestial bodies.

Ultimately, Amon met his defeat and was imprisoned. In the wake of this treacherous act, the Bright Lord decreed that henceforth, Amon would be forever referred to as "The Great Betrayer." This significant event became known as "The Great Betrayal." In the aftermath, the Bright Lord imparted upon his followers the Tenets of Fear, further shaping their beliefs and guiding their path in the world.

- _"Fear the return of the Dead God"_
- _"Fear the indelible mark of the Undying"_
- _"Fear all tyrants, for true freedom should know no bounds"_

### The Ascension of the Bright Lord

Devoid of light, the people of Terra suffered immensely to the horrors that lurk in the endless darkness. And so, after the Great Betrayal, the Bright Lord ascended to the heavens. High above, the Bright Lord took upon himself the eternal task of tending to the heart of the dying star, infusing it with his own vitality and radiance. From this celestial vantage point, the Bright Lord keeps a vigilant eye over his beloved creations, ever watchful and protective. This act began the Radiant Cycle, the gradual fading over many months towards a red star before being revitalized to a pristine condition in an act of brilliant heavenly radiance.

As the Bright Lord ascended, the remaining Brights on Terra established their own sects within the realm of Brightinism. This diversification led many individuals to embrace the role of priest or priestess,  pursuing a sacred path of devotion and guidance under a particular Bright.

The Bright Lord’s Ascension marked the age, later referred to as the Dark Age, and was the founding of a new age, the Dawn Age.

### The Dawn Age

Thus commenced the Dawn Age, an era spanning 10,000 years during which Fellkin and Brightkin fought a relentless battle against the monstrous inhabitants of the planet. With sheer determination and the strength of their own blood and steel, the Bright Lord’s creations painstakingly carved out the first civilizations of Terra. These were times of conflict, where kingdoms succumbed to the perils of monsters, diseases, internal strife and each other.

### The High Age

Eventually, the Dawn Empire emerged as the dominant power, with its resplendent capital, Crossroad, standing at the heart of the continent. From this mighty seat of power, they asserted their control, compelling the kingdoms of Terra to bow before them or face their furious wrath.

And so, with the founding of the Dawn Empire, came about the High Age, an epoch characterized by a semblance of peace and prosperity. Under the rule of Brightkin Emperor Commudus Lightbringer, the realm experienced a period of relative tranquility.

## The Bright Pantheon

Brights are a group of beings that are most commonly associated with the Bright Lord himself. The term Bright, should not be seen as an indication of the luminosity of the beings, but rather their association with the Bright Lord. In some cultures around Terra, Brights are also referred to as gods.

## Other Deities

### The Moon Presence

Many inhabitants of Terra hold reverence for the Moon Presence, considering it a primal force that predates even the arrival of the Bright Lord. Legends speak of a time when the Moon Presence was whole, but during the Great Betrayal, the epic clash between Amon and the Bright Lord caused the moon to fracture, splitting it into two separate entities.

The Old One

The larger of the two moons that grace the skies of Terra. Filled with anger and resentment due to its separation from its other half, the Old One is believed to harbor animosity toward the Bright Lord and his followers.

The Younger

The smaller of the two moons that adorn the celestial expanse of Terra. Revered as the gentler aspect of the Moon Presence, the Younger moon is associated with benevolent influences, such as guiding sailors safely home, ensuring the well-being of pregnant mothers, and bringing forth gentle tides.

## Terra

### The Sun of Terra

The radiant Sun of Terra exhibits a mesmerizing cycle of colors. It initiates its celestial journey with a gentle warmth, casting a luminous yellowish glow upon the land. As the cycle progresses, the Sun transitions into captivating shades of orange and red, illuminating the sky with an enchanting radiance. Gradually, it grows in size, commanding a more prominent presence above Terra. At the culmination of its cycle, a magnificent burst of light emanates, drawing the star back together and restoring its initial warm yellow hue. Although the exact duration of this cycle varies, it typically occurs every 3-5 months.

### The Continent

The sprawling Continent stretches across the vast expanse of Terra, its colossal size dominating a large portion of the planet. Legend speaks of the Brights, in their valiant conquest of Terra, harnessing the power of mighty magma dragons and formidable wyrms dwelling deep within the planet's tectonic plates. These creatures, brought under the control of the Brights, played a pivotal role in unifying the fragmented landmasses of Terra, forging a cohesive and interconnected continent. Their subjugation became a testament to the indomitable spirit and dominion of the Brights over the sprawling lands they sought to conquer.

## Languages of Terra

### Babelish

A gift from the Bright Lord to Fellkind after their creation. Seen as the common tongue across most of Terra. Simple and practical, it is used extensively by the common folk.

### Bright-speak

Said to be the language of the Bright Lord and his Brights. A beautiful language that almost sounds like singing. This language is spoken exclusively in the higher echelons of Brightkin society and at the Imperial senate.

### Pirish

A sophisticated language spoken by Dhampires and in upper class society across Redland. It originates from the Vampires that roamed Terra from before the Bright Lord arrived.

### Deep-speak

Spoken by Sea-folk, sailors, and anyone that does business on or near water. A flowing language, which underwater is much more pleasant to the ear

### Primal

Spoken by Lycans across the Isles of Crest and Leodelphia. A sequence of grunt, snarls, and growls. Words don't really exist in it, as it conveys intention more than specific words. Can be used to roughly communicate with wildlife, though poorly.  No written script.

### Kikishi

Spoken by the Chitinkin (Kiki) and across the Underworld (the giant caverns that stretch beneath the surface of Terra). A series of clicks form the basis of the language.

### Draconic

A very rare and ancient language that has existed since before creation. Since Dragonkin are rare, this language is only used amongst themselves. An almost serpentine like language in sound.

### Demonic

Said to be spoken by demons, no record exists of it, only myths.

## Diseases of Terra

### The Spore

The spore is an insidious parasitic fungus that exerts control over the brainstem of its unfortunate victims. Manifesting as a vibrant, luminous whitish-blue fungus, it releases airborne spores into the environment. Inhalation of even a small quantity of these spores leads to death within 1-3 months, while exposure to a significant amount results in rapid demise within a day to just a few minutes.

Once deceased, there follows a peculiar 36-hour hibernation period, after which the deceased individuals awaken and embark on a relentless quest to infect new victims. Over time, the fungus gradually emerges from the decaying host, seeking a high vantage point from which to disperse its spores far and wide.

During their dormant state, these infected individuals are referred to as carriers, serving as unwitting vessels for the propagation of the spore.

### Shards

## Magic Systems

All of Fallen’s 3 magic systems (Fellcraft, Miracles, and Runecraft) are built of the same rule in combat, which you can refer to over on Fogent Roleplay. Instead of listing this out 3 times. Keep in mind the following while reading the pre-made Fallen magic systems listed further below.

- Magic = Fellcraft/Miracles/Runecraft
- Resource = Ichor/Light/Energy
- Cantrip = Trick/Wonder/Sign
- Magic Vocation = Fellkin/Brightkin/Runesmith

## Miracles

When the Bright Lord gave onto the first loyal women of Fellkind his children, the resulting offspring were the first Brightkin of Terra. Brightkin have the ability to use the power of the Brighlord, known as Miracles. Miracles consider the laws of nature a mere suggestion. To perform a Miracle, Light is channeled through specific strong emotion or memories to receive a desired effect.
Miracles require training and practice to use, harnessing one's emotions. Most Brightkin don't devote themselves to mastering Miracles, though they enjoy the benefits of near immortality.

### Miracle Roll

This roll represents your abilities with Miracles. A minimum of one Light is required to make a non-Wonder Miracle Roll. Light up to the level in the user’s Brightkin vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Miracle Roll for each Light consumed.

- Miracles Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Miracle Skill) + Xd6 (STR/RFX/INT) + Xd6 (Light consumed capped by Brightkin Vocation)

### Light

Light is the catalyst for all Miracles. It is channeled through an emotion or memory to produce a desired effect.

- +3 Light per Brightkin Vocation

#### Generate Light

All Brightkin have an inner light. Maintaining one's physical health restores Light gradually over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels.

A short rest (1 hour) regains Ichor equal to their Brightkin Vocation level. This can only be performed once per long rest. A long rest (8 hours) with proper nutrition and hydration regains Light completely.

#### Absorb Light

Brightkin can absorb Light via ample sources of light (such as the Sun) or by drawing on powerful emotion/memories.

The ability can be used once for each Brightkin level, resetting on long rests. The level in the specific Miracle skill used dictates how much Light is regained. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

### Miracle Wonders

Wonders are uses of Miracles that use an insignificant  amount of Light. In general, Wonders should be small and happen close to the user. Making your hand a flashlight, making your eyes grow faintly, or making small illusions are examples of Wonders. Wonders can be used even if the user's Light is completely depleted.

- Cannot benifit from Brightkin assists (as no Light is consumed)
- Light Requirement: 0 Light (No Light can be used to increase dice)

### [Radiance](ZC/Radiance.md)

### [Blessing](ZC/Blessing.md)

## Fellcrafts

The monsters of Terra are known for their terrifying speed, strength, and elemental abilities. Their bodies achieve these abilities by using the potential energy found in their blood, referred to as Ichor.

Due to their monstrous ancestry, Fellkind carries Ichor in their veins as well. Fellkin are able to express their dormant genes, mimicking the terrifying genetic abilities of their monstrous ancestors. These abilities can often entail rather grotesque restructuring of the user's physiology. Fellcraft takes training, practice, and study to master, leading most Fellkin never follow the path of mastering Fellcraft.

### Fellcraft Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Fellcraft. A minimum of one Ichor is required to make a non-Trick Fellcraft Roll. Ichor up to the level in the user’s Fellkin vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Fellcraft Roll for each Ichor consumed.

- Fellcraft Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Fellcraft Skill) + Xd6 (STR/RFX/INT) + Xd6 (Ichor Consumed capped by Fellkin Vocation)

### Ichor

Ichor is the potential energy found in both monster and Fellkind blood. This energy is responsible for all of Fellcraft.

- +3 Ichor per Fellkin Vocation

#### Regaining Ichor

Maintaining one's physical health restores Ichor over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels.

A short rest (1 hour) regains Ichor equal to their Fellkin Vocation level. This can only be performed once per long rest. A long rest (8 hours) with proper nutrition and hydration regains Ichor completely.

#### Absorbing Ichor

Fellkin can absorb and feed on an ample sources of primal elements that correspound to their Fellcrafts to regain Ichor.

Ichor can be absorbed once for each Fellcraft Vocation level, resetting on long rests. The level in the specific Fellcraft skill used dictate how much Ichor is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the element are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

### Fellcraft Tricks

Tricks are uses of Fellcraft that use an insignificant amount of Ichor. In general, Tricks should be small and happen close to the user. Igniting your fingertips to light a cigar with Blazecraft, stirring a cup of tea with Hydrocraft, or creating a gentle breeze with Galecraft are all examples of Tricks. Trick attacks are considered the weakest form of offense, only used in dire situations or for utility.

- Cannot benifit from Fellkin assists (as no Ichor is consumed)
- Ichor Requirement: 0 Ichor (No Ichor can be used to increase dice)

### Fellcraft Tree

The only way for Fellkin to obtain new Fellcraft is to emulate the genetic links of the Monsters they originate from.

This tree represents the different path to acquire different Fellcrafts. Each solid line represents a monster whose genes bridge between Fellcrafts. For instance, Vampires represent the links between Hemacraft and Mindcraft as well as Mindcraft and Shadowcraft. While Vampires represent this on the Fellcraft Tree, these genes may exist in other monsters. This tree just shows the natural progression a Fellkin could take to acquire new fellcraft.

Squares represent normal Fellcrafts. These can be accessed if you choose this if your race has access or if you have a neighboring Fellcraft square already at level 1 in that Fellcraft skill. Any newly gained Fellcraft starts at level -1.

Circles represent Fellcraft combinations, which require the Fellcrafts that attach to it in order to use. The level of the combo Fellcraft is equal to the lowest dice roll of the Fellcrafts required.

## Runecraft

Runes are symbols that have been discovered, usually via academic endeavors, dreams, meditation and psychedelic experiences, that represent fundamental laws that govern reality. Runesmiths  use conscious thought to manipulate reality in a favorable direction.

Pure Runes are the most basic states of reality and  take raw energy as their inputs. Compound Runes are more complex runes constructed using pure runes. It should be noted, that at some point the energy within must be converted back to a physical phenomena, else there is no telling what will happen.

Runes can be used to make all kinds of marvels. Scrolls, Potions, Runeforged items are applications of Runecraft. Scrolls are very common due to their ease of creation and affordability.

To draw a rune is not enough to have it take effect. First, a conscious being must create the Rune. Secondly, the user must deeply understand the concept they are trying to invoke and be able to take it into conscious thought. Intelligence seems to be the gateway to Runecraft, as minds that are too weak buckle under the weight of the knowledge of the fabric of reality, leading to horrific accidents, madness, and death.

### Runecraft Roll

This roll represents your abilities with specific Runecrafts. A minimum of 1 Energy  is required to make a  Runecraft Roll. Energy  up to the level in the user’s Runesmith vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Runecraft Roll for each Energy consumed.

- Runecraft Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Runecraft Skill) + Xd6 (INT) + Xd6 (Energy Consumed capped by Runesmith Vocation)

### Crafting a Rune

Three things are required to craft a Rune.

- The knowledge of the rune.
- The energy required to create the rune.
- An object to hold the rune.

### Knowledge of Runes

In order for Runes to work, the user must consciously look beyond the mere symbols into the exposed laws of reality, understand the property they are trying to manifest and bind the phenomena that they are trying to control to a symbol. Common symbols have been agreed upon through the ages as a way for scholars and runesmiths to share they’re work. In many ways, Runes act as safeguards for the user's consciousness, reducing the infinite laws of reality to a single phenomena. If the user is sufficiently intelligent to understand the complexity of a Rune, they may bind the desired phenomena within the Rune.

If an insufficiently intelligent  person tried to simply draw the shape of the Rune of Fire, nothing would happen. Though if they truly tried to understand the Rune, the concept of fire itself, their mind could be permanently damaged forever.

### Energy Example

While anything could hypothetically be used for energy, generally runesmiths lean towards more energy dense sources as they are simply easier to carry.

#### Ichor from Monster or Fellkin blood

Ichor is a plentiful source of energy, common, and very energy dense. It is by far the most commonly used energy for Runecraft.  Requires an Inverse Rune of Blood to output the energy.

#### Charged Electrite

A charged electrite crystal is commonly used to store the required energy, as it is extremely stable. Requires an Inverse Rune of Electricity to output the energy.

### An object to hold the rune

Most Runesmith use scrolls for simple one time use runes, as they are affordable and easy to write runes on. Usually, the object the rune is located on physically receives damage up to the activation of the rune, as the energy stored within the object is consumed.
Some Runesmith will create staves of other conduits inscribed with runes. These are made in a particular way to resist the toll of the rune, though they will eventually need to be repaired.

It is known that the body can be a vessel for runes, though the effect often leads to a reduced life span, bad health, or madness. Though due to the immense power that can be gained, many take on the risk.

### Overcharging Runes

When creating a rune, a runesmith can overload a rune with energy, resulting in an additional +1d6 to the effect. However, since the rune was not made properly (as you are going above your Runesmith Vocation energy cap) the rune will have erratic behavior. Roll a d20 to determine the nature of the malfunction.

| 1   | You suddenly realize that you are nothing more than a fictional character in a game played by other creatures in another plane of existence, which causes you to be stunned. This existential crisis lasts until the start of your next turn, after which you shake it off as nonsense. |

| 5   | All doors and windows within 60' of the caster fly open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6   | You permanently lose the ability to smell. This sense can be restored with a spell that removes curses such as remove curse.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7   | The spell's target becomes overwhelmed by a desire to eat the caster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Runecraft in Combat

Runecraft takes time to do properly, Runesmiths prepare their Runecrafts well ahead of when they would actually need them. Trying to create runes in battle is at best foolish and usually a death sentence.

Simple Pure Runes bound to scrolls are an extremely common way of preparing for combat. When the user creates the scroll, they are able to craft a specific rune, and at the time they choose to use it, they will use their specific Runecraft roll from when it was created as its combat roll.

### Compound Runes

Compound Runes are constructed with Pure Runes, some of which are famous and named after their creators. Compound Runes and rare Pure runes are controlled by powerful universities and the Royal families that sponsor them. The length to which they will go to protect their intellectual property is staggering.

#### Slow Fall

Choose creatures within range. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 10 feet per second. If the creature lands before the effect ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the effect for that creature.

##### Challenge Level

**CL 1:** 1 people, 20 sec duration, 30 ft range

**CL 2:** 3 people, 45 sec duration, 45 ft range

**CL 3:** 5 people, 1 min duration, 60 ft range

##### Requirement

INT Level: 1

Energy Required: 1 energy minimum

Constructed using the Rune of Air, Rune of Gravity, and Rune of Mind.

#### Oil Spill

Slick greasy oil covers the ground in a circle centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the oil appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on an Acrobatics Check or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Acrobatics Check or fall prone

##### Challenge Level

**CL 1:** 2 ft radius, 30 sec duration, 30 ft range, Challenge Level 3

**CL 2:** 4 ft radius, 45 sec duration, 45 ft range, Challenge Level 3

**CL 3:** 6 ft radius, 1 min duration, 60 ft range, Challenge Level 3

**+2 ft of radius for every level above, + 15 sec duration, +15 ft of range**

##### Requirement

INT Requirment: 1

Energy Required: 1 energy minimum

Constructed using the Rune of Sound , Rune of Mind, and Rune of Body.

#### Minor Mirage

This spell allows you to conjure a sound or an image of an object within a certain range, and it remains in existence for the duration of the spell. The illusion will also cease to exist if you dismiss it using an action, or if you cast the spell again.

When creating a sound, you have control over its volume, which can range from a soft whisper to a piercing scream. The sound can take the form of your voice, someone else's voice, the roar of a lion, the beating of drums, or any other sound of your choosing. Throughout the spell's duration, the sound will persist continuously, or you can opt to produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell's conclusion.

If you decide to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, its size cannot exceed that of a 5-foot cube. However, this image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. If someone attempts to interact with the image physically, they will discover it to be an illusion, as objects can pass through it.

Should a creature use its action to closely examine the sound or image, they can potentially discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an General Knowledge check against your spell save DC. If the creature successfully identifies the illusion, it will appear faint to them.

##### Challenge Level

CL 1: 1 people, 30 sec duration, 30 ft range

CL 2: 3 people, 45 sec duration, 45 ft range

CL 3: 5 people, 1 min duration, 60 ft range

+2 people for every level above, + 15 sec duration, +15 ft of range

##### Requirement

INT Requirment: 1

Constructed using the Rune of Mind.

#### Flame Tongued

You can  speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. This sword gains the Fire damage type, and loses the Bleed damage type. The flames last until you  speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

The blade can only be ignited as long as it is above 3 durability. The sword can be submerged in fire to repair the blade.

##### Challenge Level

### Pure Runes

Compound Runes are constructed with Pure Runes, some of which are famous and named after their creators. Compound Runes and rare Pure runes are controlled by powerful universities and the Royal families that sponsor them. The length to which they will go to protect their intellectual property is staggering, as an arms race between runes and biological magic develops.

#### Rune of Fire

#### Rune of Earth

#### Rune of Water

#### Rune of Air

#### Rune of Electricity

#### Rune of Cold

#### Rune of Toxins

#### Rune of Blood

#### Rune of Light

#### Rune of Dark

#### Rune of Sound

#### Rune of Body

#### Rune of Mind

Some Runes pertaining to consciousness have been discovered such as the Mind Rune. This discovery was groundbreaking, as it not only allowed Runesmith to allow conscious thought to influence Compound Runes, but also validated models that predict hypothetical runes pertaining to higher abstractions of consciousness such as fear, hate, and wrath. The models predict these Forbidden Runes to be so powerful that the Great Runesmiths of Academia search for them relentlessly.

#### Rune of Soul

#### Rune of Focus

#### Rune of Unfocus

#### Rune of Time

#### Rune of Strength

#### Rune of Gravity or Mass
