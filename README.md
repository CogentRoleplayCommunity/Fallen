## World Lore

On a dead world, at the end of time, life begins once again...

![alt_text](Terra/TheContinent.png "image_tooltip")

### The Dawn Age

Thus commenced the Dawn Age, an era spanning 10,000 years during which Fellkin and Brightkin fought a relentless battle against the monstrous inhabitants of the planet. With sheer determination and the strength of their own blood and steel, the Bright Lordâ€™s creations painstakingly carved out the first civilizations of Terra. These were times of conflict, where kingdoms succumbed to the perils of monsters, diseases, internal strife and each other.

### The High Age

Eventually, the Dawn Empire emerged as the dominant power, with its resplendent capital, Crossroad, standing at the heart of the continent. From this mighty seat of power, they asserted their control, compelling the kingdoms of Terra to bow before them or face their furious wrath.

And so, with the founding of the Dawn Empire, came about the High Age, an epoch characterized by a semblance of peace and prosperity. Under the rule of Brightkin Emperor Commudus Lightbringer, the realm experienced a period of relative tranquility.

## The Bright Pantheon

Brights are a group of beings that are most commonly associated with the Bright Lord himself. The term Bright, should not be seen as an indication of the luminosity of the beings, but rather their association with the Bright Lord. In some cultures around Terra, Brights are also referred to as gods.

## Terra

### The Sun of Terra

The radiant Sun of Terra exhibits a mesmerizing cycle of colors. It initiates its celestial journey with a gentle warmth, casting a luminous yellowish glow upon the land. As the cycle progresses, the Sun transitions into captivating shades of orange and red, illuminating the sky with an enchanting radiance. Gradually, it grows in size, commanding a more prominent presence above Terra. At the culmination of its cycle, a magnificent burst of light emanates, drawing the star back together and restoring its initial warm yellow hue. Although the exact duration of this cycle varies, it typically occurs every 3-5 months.

### The Continent

The sprawling Continent stretches across the vast expanse of Terra, its colossal size dominating a large portion of the planet. Legend speaks of the Brights, in their valiant conquest of Terra, harnessing the power of mighty magma dragons and formidable wyrms dwelling deep within the planet's tectonic plates. These creatures, brought under the control of the Brights, played a pivotal role in unifying the fragmented landmasses of Terra, forging a cohesive and interconnected continent. Their subjugation became a testament to the indomitable spirit and dominion of the Brights over the sprawling lands they sought to conquer.

## Languages of Terra

### Babelish

A gift from the Bright Lord to Fellkind after their creation. Seen as the common tongue across most of Terra. Simple and practical, it is used extensively by the common folk.

### Bright-speak

Said to be the language of the Bright Lord and his Brights. A beautiful language that almost sounds like singing. This language is spoken exclusively in the higher echelons of Brightkin society and at the Imperial senate.

### Pirish

A sophisticated language spoken by Dhampires and in upper class society across Redland. It originates from the Vampires that roamed Terra from before the Bright Lord arrived.

### Deep-speak

Spoken by Sea-folk, sailors, and anyone that does business on or near water. A flowing language, which underwater is much more pleasant to the ear

### Primal

Spoken by Lycans across the Isles of Crest and Leodelphia. A sequence of grunt, snarls, and growls. Words don't really exist in it, as it conveys intention more than specific words. Can be used to roughly communicate with wildlife, though poorly.  No written script.

### Kikishi

Spoken by the Chitinkin (Kiki) and across the Underworld (the giant caverns that stretch beneath the surface of Terra). A series of clicks form the basis of the language.

### Draconic

A very rare and ancient language that has existed since before creation. Since Dragonkin are rare, this language is only used amongst themselves. An almost serpentine like language in sound.

### Demonic

Said to be spoken by demons, no record exists of it, only myths.

## Diseases of Terra

### The Spore

The spore is an insidious parasitic fungus that exerts control over the brainstem of its unfortunate victims. Manifesting as a vibrant, luminous whitish-blue fungus, it releases airborne spores into the environment. Inhalation of even a small quantity of these spores leads to death within 1-3 months, while exposure to a significant amount results in rapid demise within a day to just a few minutes.

Once deceased, there follows a peculiar 36-hour hibernation period, after which the deceased individuals awaken and embark on a relentless quest to infect new victims. Over time, the fungus gradually emerges from the decaying host, seeking a high vantage point from which to disperse its spores far and wide.

During their dormant state, these infected individuals are referred to as carriers, serving as unwitting vessels for the propagation of the spore.

### Shards

## Magic Systems

All of Fallen's 3 magic systems (Fellcraft, Miracles, and Runecraft) are built of the same rule in combat, which you can refer to over on Fogent Roleplay. Instead of listing this out 3 times. Keep in mind the following while reading the pre-made Fallen magic systems listed further below.

- Magic = Fellcraft/Miracles/Runecraft
- Resource = Ichor/Light/Energy
- Cantrip = Trick/Wonder/Sign
- Magic Vocation = Fellkin/Brightkin/Runesmith
