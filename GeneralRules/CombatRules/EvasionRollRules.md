# Evasion Roll Rules

When an attack is made against a character who is not returning fire or attacking back, the defender can make an Evasion Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. Any levels over the defender's Evasion wins count as victories for the attacker. The Evasion Roll counts for the entire round. A Combat Roll and Evasion Roll can both be made in a round. If the character takes the Defensive combat modifier, then it is also applied.

- Evasion Roll = Base dice + RFX + Acrobatics Skill + Defensive modifier (if declared)
