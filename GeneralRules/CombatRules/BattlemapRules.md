# Battlemap Rules

## Movement

Each grid of the battle map represents a 5x5 ft square.

|         Description         |                      Calculation                      |
| :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|   Humanoid Movement Speed   | 30 ft (Base), +10 ft (per RFX), +5 ft (per Athletics) |
|     Humanoid Swim Speed     | 15 ft (Base), +10 ft (per STR), +5 ft (per Athletics) |
|     Humanoid Climb Speed     |   15 ft (Base), +5 ft (per STR), +5 ft (per Climb)   |
|   4-Legged Movement Speed   | 50 ft (Base), +10 ft (per RFX), +5 ft (per Athletics) |
| Fast 4-Legged Movement Speed | 65 ft (Base), +10 ft (per RFX), +5 ft (per Athletics) |

- If a creature has a negative in the governing attribute, remove the indicated distance instead.
- If a creature has a negative in the governing skill, remove the indicated distance instead.
- If movement will always be multiplication of 5 ft. Round down to the nearest multiple of 5 ft. For instance, if I have 16 ft of movement due to being at 80% of my speed due to medium weight, I would only move 15 ft total.

## Size

If there is a difference in size between two creatures who have contested checks where size would be an advantage or disadvantage, the narrator should adapt accordingly.

|   Description   |          Effect          |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Tiny Size    | 2.5x2.5 ft on battle map. |
|   Small Size   |   5x5 ft on battle map.   |
|   Medium Size   |   5x5 ft on battle map.   |
|   Large Size   |  10x10 ft on battle map.  |
|    Huge Size    |  15x15 ft on battle map.  |
| Gargantuan Size |  20x20 ft on battle map.  |

## Difficult Terrain

Steep mountains, ice-covered ground, swamps, etc. are difficult terrain. It takes twice the movement to move through these terrains (10 feet instead of 5 feet).

# Mounts in combat

- When a mounted character or their mount takes an injury in combat, a Acrobatic check equivalent to the injury level must be succeeded to stay on horseback, else they are knocked off.
- If the character has the Ride vocational skill, when using a mount's movement speed instead of their own they can reduce the penalty associated with riding without any skill.

| Ride SkillÂ Level | Combat Movement Speed |
| :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|      0 skill      |  Mount Speed -25 ft  |
|      1 skill      |  Mount Speed -15 ft  |
|      2 skill      |  Mount Speed -10 ft  |
|      3 skill      |   Mount Speed -5 ft   |
|      4 skill      |   Mount Speed -0 ft   |
