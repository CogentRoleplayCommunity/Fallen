Some Runes pertaining to consciousness have been discovered such as the Mind Rune. This discovery was groundbreaking, as it not only allowed Runesmith to allow conscious thought to influence Compound Runes, but also validated models that predict hypothetical runes pertaining to higher abstractions of consciousness such as fear, hate, and wrath. The models predict these Forbidden Runes to be so powerful that the Great Runesmiths of Academia search for them relentlessly.
