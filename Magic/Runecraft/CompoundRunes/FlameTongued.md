You can  speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. This sword gains the Fire damage type, and loses the Bleed damage type. The flames last until you  speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

The blade can only be ignited as long as it is above 3 durability. The sword can be submerged in fire to repair the blade.
