# Minor Mirage

You can manifest either a sound or an image of an object within a specified range, and it persists for the spell's duration. The illusion will also dissipate if you choose to dismiss it as an action or if you cast the spell again.

When you opt for a sound, you have control over its volume, which can vary from a mere whisper to a thunderous scream. It could resemble your own voice, another person's voice, the mighty roar of a lion, the rhythmic beat of drums, or any other sound you desire. The chosen sound will persist continuously throughout the spell's duration, or you can produce discrete sounds at different moments before the spell concludes.

If you choose to create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it cannot exceed the volume listed below. This illusory image lacks the ability to produce sound, light, scent, or any other sensory effects. When physically interacted with, the illusion is exposed as such because objects and beings can pass through it without obstruction.

If a creature dedicates its action to scrutinizing the sound or image, it may discern that it is an illusion by succeeding in an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature successfully identifies the illusion, it becomes faint and transparent to that creature.
