## Fellcraft

The monsters of Terra are known for their terrifying speed, strength, and elemental abilities. Their bodies achieve these abilities by using the potential energy found in their blood, referred to as Ichor.

Due to their monstrous ancestry, Fellkind carries Ichor in their veins as well. Fellkin are able to express their dormant genes, mimicking the terrifying genetic abilities of their monstrous ancestors. These abilities can often entail rather grotesque restructuring of the user's physiology. Fellcraft takes training, practice, and study to master, leading most Fellkin never follow the path of mastering Fellcraft.

### Fellcraft Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Fellcraft. A minimum of one Ichor is required to make a non-Trick Fellcraft Roll. Ichor up to the level in the userâ€™s Fellkin vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Fellcraft Roll for each Ichor consumed.

- Fellcraft Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Fellcraft Skill) + Xd6 (STR/RFX/INT) + Xd6 (Ichor Consumed capped by Fellkin Vocation)

### Ichor

Ichor is the potential energy found in both monster and Fellkind blood. This energy is responsible for all of Fellcraft.

- +3 Ichor per Fellkin Vocation

#### Regaining Ichor

Maintaining one's physical health restores Ichor over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels.

A short rest (1 hour) regains Ichor equal to their Fellkin Vocation level. This can only be performed once per long rest. A long rest (8 hours) with proper nutrition and hydration regains Ichor completely.

#### Absorbing Ichor

Fellkin can absorb and feed on an ample sources of primal elements that correspound to their Fellcrafts to regain Ichor.

Ichor can be absorbed once for each Fellcraft Vocation level, resetting on long rests. The level in the specific Fellcraft skill used dictate how much Ichor is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the element are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

### Fellcraft Tricks

Tricks are uses of Fellcraft that use an insignificant amount of Ichor. In general, Tricks should be small and happen close to the user. Igniting your fingertips to light a cigar with Blazecraft, stirring a cup of tea with Hydrocraft, or creating a gentle breeze with Galecraft are all examples of Tricks. Trick attacks are considered the weakest form of offense, only used in dire situations or for utility.

- Cannot benifit from Fellkin assists (as no Ichor is consumed)
- Ichor Requirement: 0 Ichor (No Ichor can be used to increase dice)

### Fellcraft Tree

The only way for Fellkin to obtain new Fellcraft is to emulate the genetic links of the Monsters they originate from.

This tree represents the different path to acquire different Fellcrafts. Each solid line represents a monster whose genes bridge between Fellcrafts. For instance, Vampires represent the links between Hemacraft and Mindcraft as well as Mindcraft and Shadowcraft. While Vampires represent this on the Fellcraft Tree, these genes may exist in other monsters. This tree just shows the natural progression a Fellkin could take to acquire new fellcraft.

Squares represent normal Fellcrafts. These can be accessed if you choose this if your race has access or if you have a neighboring Fellcraft square already at level 1 in that Fellcraft skill. Any newly gained Fellcraft starts at level -1.

Circles represent Fellcraft combinations, which require the Fellcrafts that attach to it in order to use. The level of the combo Fellcraft is equal to the lowest dice roll of the Fellcrafts required.
