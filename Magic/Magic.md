## Magic

All of Fallen's 3 magic systems (Fellcraft, Miracles, and Runecraft) are built of the same rule in combat, which you can refer to over on Fogent Roleplay. Instead of listing this out 3 times. Keep in mind the following while reading the pre-made Fallen magic systems listed further below.

- Magic = Fellcraft/Miracles/Runecraft
- Resource = Ichor/Light/Energy
- Cantrip = Trick/Wonder/Sign
- Magic Vocation = Fellkin/Brightkin/Runesmith
