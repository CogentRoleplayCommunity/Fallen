# Magic

This document provides generalized rules for magic system mechanics built to integrate with Cogent Roleplay. Once you understood, all three of Fallen's magic systems are quite easy to understand, acting as roleplay considerations or flavor. If you are playing Fallen, you will probably just use the premade magic systems. But if you were wanting to make your own magic system for your own world, the generalized magic system mechanics are a great scaffolding.

- Magic Name = Fellcraft/Miracles/Runecraft
- Magic Vocation = Fellkin/Brightkin/Runesmith
- Magic Resource = Ichor/Light/Energy
- Cantrip = Trick/Wonder/Sign
- Governing Core Skill = Endurnace/Willpower/Willpower

## Fallen Magic systems

### [Fellcraft](Fellcraft/Fellcraft.md)

### [Miracles](Miracles/Miracles.md)

### [Runecraft](Runecraft/Runecraft.md)

## Magic Skill Levels

### Level -1: Party Trick

Generally the starting place of all magic skills.

Representing some minuet latent potential, such as a genetic ability that has yet to be honed. Those with this level are objectively bad at using this skill. This level of proficeny might be a fun party trick or for convience but has no awe inspiring use.

Those have a Party Trick level in a fire magic skill would allow you to ignite your finger tips to  light a cigar, though you could just use a match, flint and steel, or a lighter. You could throw hot smoke at someones face, though you could just punch them in the face instead for similar if not better results.

### Level 0: Novice

Representing an inexperienced level of skill.

### Level 1: Apprentice

Represting a level of skill where the basics have been learned.

### Level 2: Adept

Skill level where the basics have been fully understood and the more advanced concepts are being learned.

### Level 3: Expert

Skill level where advanced concepts have been fuly understood and master level concepts are beginning to be introduced.

### Level 4: Master

Skill level where a master level of proficency has been achived.

## Magic Resource

Magic Resources are consumed to use magic.

- +3 to Magic Resource pool per Magic Vocation level
- +1 to Magic Resource pool per Governing Skill

### Resting for Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Magic Resource over time.

#### Short Resting

A short rest takes roughly 1 hour does nothing demanding. Durning this time they can tend to wounds, eat, drink, or relax.

Once per day, characters can regain Magic Resource equal to the wins from their Governing Core Skill roll (remember you can assist with your Magic Vocation).

#### Long Resting

This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. A long rest of roughly 8 hours of downtime. Durning this downtime, at least 6 hours must be devoted to sleep. While being awake for no more than 2 hours of a long rest, characters can treat wounds, eat, drink, relax, and stand watch.

### Absorbing Magic Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Resource using a Magic skill. This ability can be used once per day for each Magic Vocation point, resetting on long rests. The magic skill used dictates how much Magic Resource is regained determined by your skill level. If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

## Governing Core Skill

A governing core skill is used for instances when a character over exerts themselves with their magic too far, is trying to rapidly regain Magic Resource, or maintain a concentration on already cast magic.

* Magic that rely on the body to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Fellcraft) use Endurance as their governing core skill.
* Magic that relies on the mind or spirit to produce Magic Resource (such as Fallen's Runecraft or Miracles) use Willpower as their governing core skill.

## Magic Concentration

Certain magic demand your focus to keep their effects active. If you lose this focus, the spell's magic ends.

If a spell necessitates focus, the Duration entry of the spell will indicate this, and it will specify how long you can concentrate on it. You can stop concentrating at any time.

Regular activities, like moving or attacking, don't disturb your concentration. However, the following factors can disrupt your concentration:

* Casting another spell that requires focus. If you cast a spell that needs focus while you're focusing on a different spell, you lose focus on the first spell. You can't focus on two spells simultaneously.
* Suffering damage. If you take damage while focusing on a spell, you must make a governing core skill roll to maintain your focus. The challenge level is equal to the level of injury taken. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make a separate saving throw for each injury source.
* Becoming incapacitated or dying. If you're incapacitated or die, you lose focus on a spell.
* The Narrator might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave washing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a Challenge level 2 governing core skill check.

## Magic Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Magic skill. A minimum of one Resource is required to make a non-Cantrip Magic Roll. Resources up to the level in the user's Magic vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Magic Roll for each Resource consumed.

- Magic Skill Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Magic Skill) + Xd6 (Vocation Attributes) + Xd6 (Resource consumed capped by Magic Vocation level)

### Magic Cantrips

Cantrips are uses of Magic that use an insignificant amount of Resource. In general, Cantrips should be small and happen close to the user. Igniting your fingertips to light a cigar, or creating a gentle breeze are all examples of Cantrips. Cantrips attacks are considered the weakest form of offense, only used in dire situations or for utility.

- Unaffected by Magic assists (as no Magic Resource is consumed)
- Resource Requirement: 0

## Magic Range

The Range type for non cantrip ranged attacks changes depending on the user's skill level unless specified otherwise.

| Skill level |  Range Type  |
| :---------: | :----------: |
|     -1     |    Close    |
|      0      |    Short    |
|      1      |    Medium    |
|      2      |   Extended   |
|      3      |     Long     |
|      4      | Sharpshooter |

### Magic Range adjustment

If a Magic Skill has a range adjustment it is either moved up or down the table above.

For instance if I have a level 3 Magic skill with a -1 Magic Range adjustment, my magic skill has an Extended Range Type.

### Cone

Represents a character unleashing an attack over an area represented by a cone. The table below shows default cones, with the width of the cone at any point equal to the distance from the user. However, any cone that doesn't exceed effective range or the Cone Area for a specified dice roll is acceptable.

| :--------: | :--------------: | :---------: | :---------: |
|   2 dice   |      10 ft      | ~53 degrees |   50 ft^2   |
|   3 dice   |      15 ft      | ~53 degrees | 112.5 ft^2 |
|   4 dice   |      20 ft      | ~53 degrees |  200 ft^2  |
|   5 dice   |      25 ft      | ~53 degrees | 312.5 ft^2 |
|   6 dice   |      30 ft      | ~53 degrees |  450 ft^2  |
|   7 dice   |      35 ft      | ~53 degrees | 612.5 ft^2 |

|  12 dice  |      60 ft      | ~53 degrees |  1800 ft^2  |

Here is a handy equation I made for calculating custom Cones. “A” is area, “D” is distance, and theta is the angle closest to the caster. Simply plug in the Area for your dice roll, and either “D” or theta. Whatever you didn’t plugin will be calculated. If none of this makes sense, brush up on your trigonometry or just use the default cones above!
