# Vial of Healing Blood

Special blood invented by Veronica Reddington. Heals wounds and can cure a spore infection.

The process of creating Healing blood is a closely guarded secret of House Redington, as it is Redwall's largest export. During the spore epidemic, healing blood was the only known way of curing the spore infection, greatly increasing the political power of House Redington.
