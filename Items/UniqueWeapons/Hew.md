"When you chop wood, splinters fly."  - Anonymous

An unassuming rusty, yet excellent battleaxe both as versatile at chopping wood as chopping skulls.

Runecraft scholars have traced the origin of this axe to the first Fellkin who began harvesting the great iron woods of Redguard. Needing a tool that was both capable of felling the great iron woods and fending back the monstrous Lechens that roamed the forest, this weapon was forged.

Splinter:

Any weapon dice added to a combat roll are considered automatic wins when attacking a plant based creature (Leshens, Nature Dragons) or wooden structures.
