"Awake, arise, or be forever Fallen…" - Words of the Bright Lord

Sword of Luc Lightbringer. The hilt acts as a Miracle focus, allowing for devastating radiant attack. Luc has had this sword his entire life, a mysterious gift from when he was too young to remember. In many ways, this sword and Luc are one in the same. Elegant, bright, and extremely dangerous. Luc has spent his entire entire life learning the abilities of this artifact, though even he does not fully understand the weapon…

This sword was used in the execution of Helena by Uhtred Storm at Luc’s order, though it was only used to subdue her and did not deal the final blow.

Radiance Conduit: Acts as a Radiance focus, meaning it can be used to modify the base dice of all Radiance rolls.

Light Bound: This weapon is physical light, and can be absorbed and summoned by a Brightkin at will.

Hilt Gem: None
