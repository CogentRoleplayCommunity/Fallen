Dragonkin trace their monstrous ancestry from the ancient dragons that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were grafted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord.

Distinctive features of Dragonkin include horns, certain scaly sections of their skins, and pointed ears.

Dragonkin are one of the rarest races on Terra, as very few of the ancient dragons bowed to the Bright Lord during the Awakening. Dragons are a proud species and dragonkin seemed to have inherited this trait from their monstrous ancestors. Due to their low population, there is no dragonkin majority country. Instead, they occupy positions of authority in many countries across Terra. They make fine advisors and scholars as their long lives permit the ability to learn thousands of years worth of information.

Dragonkin, much like Brightkin,  appear to have an indefinite lifespan. This appears to be related to the scales across their bodies as upon their removal they begin to age and eventually perish.

Mainy Dragonkin worship the Great Leviathan, as it is said that all dragons came from it. For in a time before the creation of Terra, the Great Leviathan aided the Bright Lord. And thus the Bright Lord bestows wings upon all his descendants.
