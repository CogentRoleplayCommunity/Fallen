# Beastkin

![alt_text](Beastkin.png)

Beastkin or Lycans trace their monstrous ancestry from Werewolves and other Beastial monsters that bowed to the Bright Lord.

Since Beastkin are highly varied and shapeshifters, their appearances can vary wildly. Beastkin that live on the Isles of Crest live day to day with their beastail traits showing such as fur, claws, and beastial facial features. While in Redland, where showing these features openly is considered a social taboo, Beastkin simply have animalistic eyes and slightly larger canines. The extent to which their Beastial feature shows is completely subconscious and has usually formed by early adolescence.

Beastkin exists in many countries across Terra. Leodelphia and The Isles of Crest have a majority Beastkin population.

Leodelphia is mostly inhabited by feline beastkin centered around the capital of Oasis which is weaved into an  ancient jungle.

The Isles of Crest are mainly inhabited by canine beastkin. They are a tribal people and weary of outsiders. The largest city named Starfall is centered around where a falling star crashed in the far past.
