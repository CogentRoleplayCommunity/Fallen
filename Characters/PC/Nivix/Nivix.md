## Backstory

After waking up in a prison with amnesia, with only the number on his back as his name, he and his fellow prisoners barely were able to recover the artifact that was required for their freedom.

After returning the artifact to the strange woman that had imprisoned them, they were knocked unconscious and left on the surface in the middle of a field. 13 and 11 decided to stick together. Both trying to ascertain their pasts and help others, they decided to join the Brother hood of silver, a guild dedicated to stop monsters.

13 decided to call himself Niv, as for some odd reason it felt familiar.

Nivix has problems lying, for whenever he does he has migranes. He is unsure why this happens, believing it to be something related to his amnesia.
