## Backstory

Elowyn was born to Velena Reddington and Velstadt Lovelace. Her mother was the sister of Veronica Reddinton, current ruler of Reddland. In Elowyn's early years, she spent many months playing in the gardens of Castle Tearstone in Redwall with her cousin Vex'ahlia, Killroy, and her younger sister Livi. Flint (Vex’s father) instilled the love of archery into her and her sister. Elowyn spent hours everyday practicing her archery, becoming a child prodigy. However, when her father returned to Reddwall, Elowyn’s mother and father decided to leave the safety and warmth of Castle Tearston to pursue darker ambitions.

Elowyn and her sister were indoctrinated into the insidious Worshipers of Amon, or Cult of Amon as it is more widely known. There she was taught that the grand myth of The Awakening was a lie. That the Bright Lord and his Brightkin descendants weren’t holy saviors, but oppressors. By extension, the Dawn Empire that they had built on the backs of Fellkin was to be regarded as an evil and corrupting force on Terra, and thus must be overthrown. The Worshipers of Amon, believe that it was Amon, the Faithful One, the Great Betrayer, that protected Fellkind. They believe the reason he turned on the Bright Lord was for Fellkinds protection.

Elowyn and her sister were radicalized by their parents. When the Worshipers of Amon began planning their attack on the festival of sacrifice, Elowyn and her sister participated actively with the encouragement of their parents. But when the attack commenced, Elowyn witnessed the death of her friend Finnan, her loving aunt Veronica Reddington, her cousin Vex’hilla, and countless innocent lives. Elowyn had fought and killed Inquisitors sent after her group and family in self-defense, but never the slaughter of innocents. In that moment she made a decision that would influence the rest of her life, as she started firing arrows into her fellow cult members, trying to stop the carnage and slaughter of innocent life.

After the attack, Elowyn fled into hiding, an enemy of both the Cult and Empire. When the heat died down, Elowyn searched for her sister, praying that she had not died in the attack. But she found no trace. Assuming that the other Cult members had fled back to their headquarters near Tentcity in Southern Reddland, she began her quest back south, all alone.

After returning to Tentcity, she lent out her skills as a hired protection for coin, which she plans to use to escape with her sister when she finds her.
