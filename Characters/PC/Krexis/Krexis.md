## Backstory

After waking up in a prison with amnesia, with only the number on his back as his name, 11. Using his proficiency with the axe and shield, he and the fellow prisoner's ventured through the ancient dungeon. He and his fellow prisoners barely were able to recover the artifact that was required for their freedom.

After returning the artifact to the strange woman that had imprisoned them, they were knocked unconscious and left on the surface in the middle of a field. 11 and 13 decided to stick together. Both trying to ascertain their pasts and help others, they decided to join the Brother hood of silver, a guild dedicated to stop monsters.

11 decided to call himself Krexis, as for some odd reason it felt familiar.

Nivix is plagued by dreams of burning cities.

Krexis has an extreme addiction to beatiful women, going out of his way to seduce them.
