## Backstory

Born out of wedlock by his mudblood mother and an unknown noble father. Destin was raised by his mother and his blacksmith and ex Redd Legion member step-father, who taught him all he knows about combat.

Eventually as he grew to know that he wasnâ€™t a mudblood like his parents, and after a spat he left, taking his step-fathers old sword and pieced together equipment. He joined a mercenary company that worked with caravans on the roads between Redwall and Tentcity. He grew to love his company, and after becoming romantically involved with another mercenary named Natalie Burk, he grew to accept these people as his new family. They were then killed by a demonic entity wielding a black obsidian weapon.

After losing what he considered his second family, Destin fell into a depression that he used the potent drug Trail Laud to suppress. After joining up with another mercenary company, he eventually got close to Redwall on the day of the Festival of Sacrifice, commemorating the Emperor's fallen brother. There he witnessed a terrorist attack perpetrated by the Cult of Amon. Serendipitously, Destin was able to rescue his parents anonymously during the attack. Too ashamed of the man he had become,  he ventured south once more, looking for more work with his blade.
