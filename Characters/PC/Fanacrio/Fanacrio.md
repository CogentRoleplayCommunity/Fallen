## Backstory

The Kiki descended from the insectoid monsters known as  Kikimora. Once they were granted consciousness by the Bright Lord, their own biology structured their entire civilization. This would be known as "the Old Way'', a civilization that had many similarities to that of the Kikimore. The Old Way was ruled by structure, order, and control. The group was always prioritized over the individual. This was the time of the Great Queens. Though, over time the Old Way would fade, and the New Way would rise. This was spurred by missionaries of the Bright Lord, who introduced Kikki to the concept of freedom and self-will. Throughout the Age of Conquest, Kikki flourished. That is until The Witch Queen Alana began her quest of domination by slaughtering the Kikki Queen, and marking the beginning of the Red War. Without the protection of their Queen, Alana controlled Kikki using her mindcraft, wresting control of their will through the Old Way. They fought as the physical extensions of her will. After the death of the Witch Queen, the colony went into madness. The other races now saw Kikki as less than Fellkind. Fearing outside threats and subjugation, Chitinkin reverted to the Old Way as they cared more for their security, strength, and survival than their freedom. Those that regressed into the Old way were labeled Morakki, and those that favored the New Way were deemed Goroki.

The Uniwako is a natural ritual all Chitinking undergo, its purpose being to determine their role in the hive. All Chitinkin are labeled Pruer, meaning "unmarked" before they undergo their Uniwako. Most become workers following their Uniwako, though those special few marked by the Queen's pheromones grow up to be members of the Royal Cast. Royal cast members bear a bright teal rudania (the accents that line their exoskeletons) which are revealed after they shed their first exoskeleton. The Royal Cast can resist the influence of the Queen and create offspring. They serve as generals, advisors, dukes, and other jobs that require creativity and  self-will. Occasionally one of the Royal cast will reveal a purple rudian, which marks them as the next Queen. Fanácrio grew up among the other members of the Royal class. Fanácrio's best friend growing up in the Hive was Natt, another member of the Royal Cast. Together they grew up like royalty, trained in both Mindcraft and Exocraft(Polycraft) since birth. They would practice controlling smaller bugs and modifying their forms. They were taught about the history of their people, and about the dangerous Goroka and the ever present Kiki threat. They were made to understand from birth that they were to one day rule this kingdom, and must act like it. Structure was an everyday part of life, being told when to go to bed, eat, and study. Fanácrio didn't dislike his structured life, as he preferred minimal change, but he did take issue with what he perceived as extreme cruelness. He learned this more emotional way of thinking from his favorite book, "The Tragedy of Killroy the Fool''. Fanácrio was hooked by the intense emotions that the story portrayed. The bitter rivalry between Serena Redguard and The Witch Queen, the brotherhood of the Red Legion, and the selfless sacrifice of Killroy. These stories lived in Fanácrio's head, often day dreaming he was in Redguard and they ended up influencing his behavior. He quickly started noticing how cold and cruel his people could be to one another. In his mind, his hero Serana Redguard would never stand for bullies, and so Fanácrio would often get himself in trouble with bullies within the royal cast that would pick on the workers. He would often get bailed out by his best friend Natt the only female in his hatch group, as all the bullies of the Royal palace knew not to mess with her, as one day she might be Queen. Natt was very quiet, but seemed to enjoy listening to Fanácrio talk about the great heroics of the outside world and his fan fictions about Killroy and Serana. Fanácrio's emotions did not go unnoticed, and many in the royal casts looked down on him, scared he  might corrupt Natt with emotions.  Queen Xandala however treated Fanácrio with respect, as she could understand having selective differences of opinions around her.

When the Great Festival of Sacrifice was announced in Redguard, Fanácrio was chosen as the Caurusian emissary. Fanácrio was overjoyed to learn this. Little did he know that he had been selected for the task due to many in the Royal Cast wishing to be rid of him, hoping to at worst get rid of him for a time, and at best have him succumb to bandits on the road. Natt asked Fanácrio not to go, and she shed a single tear, which Fanácrio had never witnessed her do before. Natt pointed out that his Uniwako was fast approaching and that to have it in a foriegn place could be dangerous. Fanácrio, blinded by the call to adventure, told her not to worry, telling her he would return a great knight just like Serana. Fanácrio departed the Hive with his personal guards, headed to Redguard.These guard mysteriously vanished(abandoned him) the third day of their travels. Fanácrio, determined to fulfill his mission, continued his trek across the continent, eventually coming across two teenagers, who were also heading to Redguard. These two were Carma and Dipper, both Lycans of the great kingdom of Leodelphia. Fanácrio enjoyed his new companions' company.
