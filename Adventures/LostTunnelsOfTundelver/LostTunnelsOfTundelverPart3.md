# Part 3: The Spider's Web

In this phase of the adventure, the characters embark on a quest to follow up on existing leads and lines of inquiry. The town of Phandalin has yielded all the information it can offer, and now the characters must venture into the surrounding forests and hills to unravel the greater plots they have become entangled in. It's not mandatory for the characters to visit every location mentioned in this section.

Depending on which NPCs the characters have interacted with and the clues or quests they've undertaken, they may possess the following information:

* Sister Garaele has requested that the characters visit the banshee Agatha in the ruined town of Conyberry to inquire about Bowgentle's spellbook.
* Daran Edermath has expressed interest in discovering who lurks near the ruins at Old Owl Well.
* Qelline Alderleaf has suggested that the characters journey to the dilapidated town of Thundertree and consult with the druid Reidoth, who might possess knowledge regarding the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle, Wave Echo Cave, or both.
* Townmaster Harbin Wester desires the characters to investigate an orc encampment near Wyvern Tor and remove the orcs from the area.
* Sildar Hallwinter's mission is to locate Cragmaw Castle, search for Gundren Rockseeker, rescue the dwarf, and recover his map.

Each of these potential quests corresponds to a section in this phase of the adventure. The characters can take their time in Phandalin to rest and acquire supplies. Afterward, they must choose one of these storylines to investigate and set out for the appropriate destination.

## Triboar Trail

Phandalin is located in a region known as "the Triboar Trail," "the Triboar Cutoff," or "the Cony Gap." This expanse of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded plains lies between the Sword Mountains to the south and Neverwinter Wood to the north. The name is derived from an ancient trail that extends from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward for about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry before heading north of Phandalin and connecting with the High Road along the coast.

Feel free to describe the party's overland journeys as richly as you wish, but ensure the narrative keeps advancing. Statements such as "You travel for several miles and encounter nothing of interest" are far less evocative and memorable compared to more vivid descriptions like, "A light drizzle moistens the rolling plains as you journey north. Around midday, you pause for lunch beneath a solitary tree. There, the rogue discovers a small rock with a grinning visage. Besides this, you observe nothing out of the ordinary."

### Using the Overland Map

During this section of the adventure, the characters will frequently travel overland from one point of interest to another. As shown on the regional map on page 5, some of these locations are forty to fifty miles apart, necessitating several days of overland travel to reach the next adventure site.

**Travel Time.** Assume the party covers twenty-four miles each day, with a period of ten hours spent traveling. The characters are required to rest for eight hours each day, with the remaining six hours allotted to setting up and breaking down camp, meal preparation, and potentially some foraging or hunting.

### Wilderness Encounters

Request that the players specify the party's marching order so you know which characters are leading and which are trailing behind. When the party camps, inquire about the characters responsible for standing watch. This information is crucial if the party confronts a perilous situation.

The Triboar Trail is fraught with danger. While journeying through this region, the characters may stumble upon ravenous creatures, avaricious bandits, or ferocious monsters. To check for encounters, roll a d20 once during the day and once at night. An encounter takes place if the result falls between 17 and 20. Roll a d12 and consult the Wilderness Encounters table to determine the nature of the encounter.

Upon encountering foes, the characters earn XP for defeating them. The XP value for one creature of a particular type is provided in each creature's stat block. Multiply this value by the number of creatures faced, then divide the total XP among the characters evenly.

### Wilderness Encounters

Day Roll Night Roll Result
1-2 1-3 Stirges (1d8 + 2)
4 Ghouls (1d4 + 1)
3-4 Ogre (1)
5-6 5 Goblins (1d6 + 3)
7-8 6 Hobgoblins (1d4 + 2)
9-10 7-8 Ores (1d4 + 2)
11 9-10 Wolves (1d4 + 2)
12 11-12 Owl bear (1)

**Stirges.** These airborne predators feast on the blood of their victims and are attracted to the light of campfires at night.

**Ghouls.** These undead were once human and now hunger for living flesh.

**Ogre.** The ogre is searching for an easy meal and is too dimwitted to flee once combat commences.

**Goblins.** The goblins hold knowledge of Cragmaw Castle and can provide directions if they are captured and confronted. Each goblin carries a pouch containing 1d10 copper pieces.

**Hobgoblins.** This group of hobgoblins actively seeks the adventurers in hopes of collecting a bounty. They possess information about the location of Cragmaw Castle but won't share directions unless charmed. One of the hobgoblins carries a roughly drawn sketch of one of the party members, along with the text "25 gold pieces for this one" and a black spider symbol beneath it.

**Orcs.** These scouts are affiliated with the band currently established at Wyvern Tor. As they patrol the area, they search for travelers to ambush and homesteads to plunder.

**Owlbear.** This ravenous predator catches wind of the characters' scent and relentlessly pursues them.

## Conyberry and Agatha's Lair

The town of Conyberry fell victim to barbarian attacks several years ago and now lies in ruins. The Triboar Trail passes directly through the abandoned town, making it a convenient reference point for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. Agatha's lair is a few miles away from the town.

```
The forest grows progressively darker and quieter as the trail continues deeper into the woods. Thick vines and layers of moss drape the tree branches, and the air becomes noticeably colder compared to the ruined village. As the trail bends, the characters encounter a shelter formed from the twisted branches of closely spaced trees, woven into a dome-like structure in the shadows. An entrance of reduced height leads into the structure.
```

If the characters exercise caution and remember their purpose, they will be able to communicate with the banshee. Upon entering the shelter, narrate the following:

```
A semblance of a dwelling is nestled within the branches' dome. It contains sparse furnishings, including chests, shelves, a table, and a reclining couch, all crafted in ancient elven style.
```

Agatha senses the intrusion of the characters and materializes shortly after they enter her abode.

```
The air turns cold, and an intense feeling of dread grips you. A chilly, pale light forms in the air, swiftly assuming the shape of a female elf. Her hair and robes sway in a spectral breeze. Though she might have once been beautiful, a malevolent expression now twists her features. "Foolish mortals," she hisses. "What brings you here? Are you unaware that seeking me out leads to death?"
```

If the characters behave rudely, show disrespect, or pose threats, Agatha scowls and vanishes. She does not engage in combat or return if the characters call out to her.

### Dealing with Agatha

In the event that the characters maintain respect and politeness, Agatha can be convinced to assist them with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The player leading the conversation with the banshee makes the check, with the potential for advantage if the role-playing of the encounter is particularly well done. Should any character possess Sister Garaele's silver comb and offer it as a gift to Agatha, the check automatically succeeds.

```
The spectral figure flashes a cold, amused smile and utters, "Very well," in an ethereal tone. "I sense your multifaceted quests. Pose one query to me, and I shall impart my answer."
```

If the characters inquire about Bowgentle's spellbook, Agatha reveals that she traded the tome to a necromancer named Tsernoth in the city of Iriaebor over a century ago. She remains oblivious to the book's subsequent fate. Her response is accurate, furnishing Sister Garaele and the Harpers with the information needed to continue their search.

Alternatively, the characters may choose to inquire about another matter, such as the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle, Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost's question regarding Old Owl Well (refer to that section). Agatha is well-informed and skilled in divination, enabling her to address almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters decide to pose. However, the banshee will answer only one question, compelling the characters to select their query carefully.

#### Awarding Experinece Points

The characters receive experience points for persuading Agatha successfully to answer a question. If they achieve this, allocate 200 XP equally among the characters.

## Old Owl Well

Constructed by a long-lost empire thousands of years ago, Old Owl Well now stands as the ruins of a watchtower, consisting mainly of deteriorated walls and the remnants of a broken tower. Within the tower's courtyard stands an ancient well that still offers clean, fresh water. Old Owl Well is situated in the untamed, rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The location is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to these ruins.

In recent times, prospectors have observed that an encampment has been established at Old Owl Well. They've also noted that undead guardians have been stationed there to deter intruders.

```
As the party ascends a low ridge, they lay eyes on the decaying remnants of an ancient watchtower, situated amidst the rugged hills. The structure's walls have crumbled away, leaving behind a rudimentary courtyard adjacent to the shattered remains of an old tower. A vibrant, multicolored tent is set up in the center of the courtyard, but there is no sign of its occupant.
```

The camp is currently occupied by a mage who is fervently exploring the site, hoping to discover ancient arcane knowledge left behind by its creators. The characters have various options to access the site, either by following old trails or ascending the slope to find an opening in the encircling walls of rubble.

There are twelve zombies concealed within the shattered shell of the former watchtower, unseen from the outside. However, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher detects a putrid scent wafting from the direction of the tower. When the characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies emerge from within the structure.

If a conflict arises, Hamun Kost, the malevolent mage, emerges from his tent and inquires, "What is the meaning of this?" Kost is a robust figure clad in red robes, sporting pallid skin, a shaven scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who successfully passes a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost's tattoo as a necromantic symbol. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check confirms that the attire is typical of Thay, a far-eastern land where wizards adorn their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on Kost's forehead denotes his school of magic as necromancy.

If any character tries to initiate a dialogue with Kost, even through a greeting or by responding to his questions during combat, he momentarily halts his zombies. The Red Wizard is not overtly aggressive and is willing to negotiate a deal that serves both his interests and the party's.

Kost remains guarded regarding the reason for his presence in the area. Nevertheless, he is prepared to offer information that the party requires if they perform a favor for him. If the characters indicate their desires to Kost, he presents one or both of the following requests:

• He wishes for the removal of the ores located at Wyvern Tor since they have been scouting his camp and appear likely to cause trouble.
• Kost desires to ask a question to Agatha the banshee: "What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?" Kost will not risk incurring the banshee's wrath, but the characters can pose the question on his behalf. (Agatha knows the name: Arthindol).

#### Treasure

Within Hamun Kost's tent lies a well-appointed traveling suite, including a cot, a chair, a writing desk with supplies, and a clothing chest. Inside the chest, there is a leather bag containing 35 silver pieces, 20 electrum pieces, 20 gold pieces, 5 platinum pieces, one pearl (100 gold pieces), a potion of healing, a scroll of darkness enclosed in a bone tube, and a small jeweled box (valued at 25 gold pieces) containing an ancient Netheril ring of protection—the Red Wizard's most intriguing discovery thus far.

#### Awarding Experinece Points

Discovering the presence of the Red Wizard at Old Owl Well fulfills a quest given to the party by Daran Edermath in Phandalin. If the party parleys with Hamun Kost and reports back to Daran, divide 200 XP equally among the characters.

If the party confronts and defeats Hamun Kost and his zombies, divide 800 XP equally among the characters.

## Ruins of Thundertree

Close to the point where the Neverwinter River emerges from Neverwinter Wood stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. In the past, it was a thriving community on the edge of the forest, its prosperity stemming from the efforts of woodcutters and trappers. However, three decades ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north brought devastation to Thundertree. In the aftermath of this natural catastrophe, an unusual plague of zombies swept through the area, either killing or driving away those who survived the eruption.

While most of the zombies have since disintegrated into dust, the area's peculiar magic has transformed the local vegetation into new and perilous forms.

Few individuals dare to venture into the desolated village, and those who do rarely stay for long, except for two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area 4) periodically visits Thundertree, cautiously keeping an eye on the area's dangers. Additionally, a group of cultists has recently arrived (see area 13) to negotiate with a dragon that asserts Thundertree as its territory (see area 7).

As the party approaches the ruins, describe the scene as follows:

```
As you advance along the trail, it gradually transforms into an ancient, overgrown lane that winds through dilapidated structures consumed by vines and overgrown foliage. In the center of the settlement, a steep hill rises, crowned by a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof, and an adjacent cottage. A dirt road snakes around the base of the hill, threading its way through aged stone houses. Many of these structures have roofs in disrepair, appearing more like ruins with weather-exposed interiors. However, some structures are in a relatively intact state. The entire village is eerily silent.
```

A wooden sign affixed to a nearby post reads: "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!" This sign was placed by Reidoth to discourage groups of treasure hunters from awakening the region's monsters.

### General Features

Thundertree's structures have largely crumbled or are gradually being reclaimed by nature.

**Buildings.** In Thundertree, buildings are either in a state of ruin or still intact, as depicted on the map.

Ruined buildings consist of empty stone shells with walls ranging from 5 to 8 feet high. Their roofs have long vanished, leaving behind piles of debris within the walls. The debris makes movement challenging, as per "Difficult Terrain" rules in the rulebook.

Intact buildings are deteriorated, makeshift stone cottages that remain standing. Their wooden doors are swollen, requiring a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. These buildings feature narrow windows covered by wooden shutters containing 6-inch wide arrow slits, providing three-quarters cover to creatures on one side against attacks from the other side (as per "Cover" in the rulebook). Dusty furnishings, such as simple wooden chairs and tables, are present in most intact buildings.

**Trees and Brush.** Trees reach an average height of 30 to 40 feet and offer cover. Brush consists of large bushes that create difficult terrain.

### **1. Westernmost Cottage**

This ruined stone cottage bears the weight of time.

```
Nestled in the shadow of an ancient tree, a crumbling stone cottage devoid of its roof stands amid rampant weeds.
```

Among the weeds, two twig blights are hidden near the cottage's open doorway. A Dexterity (Stealth) check should be rolled for the blights, and the result should be compared against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether the blights are spotted.

These blights do not initiate attacks on their own (unless acting in self-defense) but rush to aid the twig blights in area 2 if combat breaks out.

#### Awarding Experience Pionts

Divide 50 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the twig blights.

### **2. Blighted Cottages**

Wind and weather have taken their toll on these structures, leaving behind very little.

```
These two ruined cottages, situated side by side, appear as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shop owners or well-to-do farmers in the past. Now, all that remains are crumbling walls and heaps of debris. Several young trees have sprouted amid the ruins.
```

Camouflaged among the ordinary foliage, there is a deadly menace - six twig blights. Detecting them necessitates a successful Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the blights' Dexterity (Stealth) check.

These plant creatures are hungry and will fight until they are destroyed. In the event of an attack, the twig blights in area 1 will join the combat one round later.

#### Treasure

A former resident, who used to live here, had stashed a chest filled with coins beneath the flagstone floor of his residence. A comprehensive search of the interior of the eastern cottage and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the old chest nestled amid the roots of a tree growing through the house. The chest holds 700 copper pieces, 160 silver pieces, and 90 gold pieces.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Divide 50 XP equally among the characters if the party overcomes these twig blights.

### **3. The Brown Horse**

This establishment used to be the renowned Brown Horse tavern, celebrated for its excellent ale.

```
A worn signboard near the entrance to this large structure displays the faded image of a workhorse holding a flagon of ale. The building appears dilapidated and sagging, but it's more intact compared to the nearby ruins.
```

In this building, shadows conceal four ash zombies (refer to the "Ash Zombies" sidebar). These undead creatures are slumped against the walls or lurking under the bar. Upon the arrival of living beings, the zombies groan and begin to stir, slowly getting to their feet (moving at half their speed to do so, as described in the "Being Prone" section in the rulebook). They relentlessly pursue any characters they spot, attacking until they are ultimately destroyed.

The eastern part of the building used to serve as the old common room, while the western portion housed the kitchens and brewer's vats. Massive wooden tuns are situated to the west, and a faint hint of yeast still lingers in the air. However, the ale is long gone.

#### Awarding Experinece Points

Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party successfully vanquishes the ash zombies.

```
ASH ZOMBIES

These abominations were born from the magical calamity caused by Mount Hotenow's eruption three decades ago. They share the same characteristics as standard zombies but possess an additional trait as follows:

Ash Puff: When a zombie sustains damage for the first time, any living creature within 5 feet of the zombie must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failing the saving throw results in disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for one minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect prematurely with a successful save.
```

### **4. Druid Watch**

This modest house is where Reidoth sets up his camp when he visits Thundertree.

```
In contrast to the nearby dilapidated structures, this small house seems to be in relatively better shape. Reinforced with heavy iron bands, the doors and thick shutters protect the windows.
```

Reidoth is a lean, white-bearded human who prefers brevity in his speech. Although he doesn't receive many visitors, he offers a reasonable level of hospitality.

Reidoth excels at avoiding the ash zombies that now inhabit the village and navigating the mutated plant life that thrives there. He's well aware of the perilous spiders lurking in the ruins at the base of the hill and suspects the presence of individuals hiding on the town's eastern side—individuals he describes as "folk in black masks and cloaks" (referring to the cultists). However, he is most concerned about the recent arrival of a green dragon in the tower (area 7). He forewarns the characters about all these dangers and advises them to depart Thundertree before they inadvertently meet their doom.

#### Developments

If the characters inquire about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth readily offers directions. As a member of the Emerald Enclave, a widely-spread organization of wilderness survivalists dedicated to preserving the natural balance and addressing threats to it, he is well-aware of the need to protect this equilibrium. The Enclave strives to maintain harmony between the elemental forces of the world, prevent the excesses of civilization and wilderness from clashing, and support those facing the dangers of the wilds. Reidoth considers the goblins as a perilous threat to this delicate balance.

Regarding Wave Echo Cave, Reidoth refuses to disclose its location but offers to guide the party there in exchange for a favor. His request is for them to confront the dragon in area 7. If they succeed in this daunting task, Reidoth will uphold his end of the bargain but will not accompany the party inside the mine.

Should the characters turn hostile and attack him for any reason, Reidoth takes the form of a gray squirrel and darts out of the cottage through a crack in the wall, disappearing into the woods. His watch post contains nothing of material value.

#### Joining the Emerald Enclave

Should the party assist Reidoth in driving away Venomfang, the druid privately approaches specific members of the group and encourages them to join the Emerald Enclave. He discusses this proposition with those who exemplify the ideal of preserving the natural order. A character who agrees is bestowed with the title of Springwarden.

**5. BLIGHTED FARMHOUSE**

To the south, this farm stands adjacent to a field with dense patches of gorse and briars.

```
The ruin in front of you appears to have been a farmhouse at one time, now only half-buried by a thick thicket. Trees have sprouted through its crumbling foundations. The lane stretches a short distance to the south, ending in an overgrown field.
```

The thicket to the east of this ruin harbors eight twig blights. Any disturbance within the ruined farmhouse, such as characters sifting through rubble, rouses the anger of the blights. In response, two twig blights head for the south doorway leading into the farmhouse, while two others head for the north doorway for three rounds. The blights aggressively attack until they are vanquished.

#### Awarding Experinece Points

Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party successfully eliminates the twig blights.

### **6. Ruined Store**

This former general store has not yet succumbed to complete ruin, with sections of its tiled roof still intact.

```
At the crossroads near the center of the village, a narrow lane ascends the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south lies a ruined building that may have functioned as a store or workshop. Webs extend across the lane, reaching from the building to the trees on the northern side of the road.
```

Inside this ruined building, two giant spiders lie in wait on the inner walls, concealed from view outside. The spiders utilize trailing lines from the webs spanning the lane, allowing them to sense the movement of potential prey. They nimbly scuttle over the walls and launch a surprise attack against any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score below 17.

The webs, which extend two squares north of the doorway, pose a hindrance. Characters attempting to traverse them must succeed in a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Failure leads to entanglement in the webs, resulting in the restrained condition (see the rulebook for details on the restrained condition). A restrained character can use an action each round to attempt to break free through a DC 12 Strength check or try to cut themselves free using a light slashing weapon. The webs possess AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.

Circumventing the webs is made difficult by the dense thickets on the north side of the road. Bypassing the ruined building to the south will lead to the twig blights in area 5.

#### Treasure

In the western half of the building, the corpse of an unfortunate adventurer is ensnared in spider silk. The body, a shriveled male elf, is sucked dry and decomposed but still clad in studded leather armor with a shortsword in its scabbard. A thorough search also reveals a potion of healing in a belt pouch, along with 23 gp and 35 sp.

EXPERIENCE POINTS

Divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party manages to defeat the giant spiders.

### 7. Dragon's Tower

This tower was previously the dwelling of a human wizard who perished while combating the ash zombies that overran Thundertree three decades ago.

```
Atop the hill, you find a round tower with an attached cottage, although half of the tower's roof is missing. A door provides access to the cottage, and numerous arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You notice a peculiar stillness in the area, coupled with an unusual, acrid odor in the air.

The lifeless bodies of two grotesque giant spiders lie near the edge of the pathway, evidently dragged there. Their distended corpses appear puckered and blistered, indicating they were mauled by a larger creature.
```

In the tower, a youthful green dragon named Venomfang recently claimed dominion. During its search for an ideal lair in the Neverwinter Wood, Venomfang chose this location. Prior to the dragon's occupancy, the tower was infested with giant spiders, evidenced by the lifeless arachnids scattered about. Venomfang eliminated them by crashing through the tower's roof. Ever since, the dragon has maintained a vigilant watch.

**Tower.** The tower features a single, spacious room with a soaring 40-foot-high ceiling. A narrow, 5-foot-wide spiral staircase winds through the interior, granting access to the open rooftop, which enables the dragon to come and go at will. Sturdy wooden beams and stair supports crisscross the tower's insides. If the characters manage to reduce Venomfang's hit points to half, the dragon ascends to the tower's pinnacle and departs, preserving the lair for another time.

**Cottage.** Within the cottage, dusty furniture lies ensnared in webs, but nothing of value can be found. Any substantial commotion within the cottage will alert the dragon, prompting it to prepare for a confrontation.

#### Treasure

An aged wooden chest, its lid broken open and resting on the tower floor, safeguards the last remnants of a deceased wizard's wealth. The chest contains 800 sp, 150 gp, four silver goblets adorned with moonstones (valued at 60 gp each), a scroll of misty step, and a scroll of lightning bolt. Venomfang takes great delight in surveying its hoard.

Remarkably, the most intriguing item in the hoard is often overlooked by the dragon. Beneath the coins lies a rustic battleaxe of dwarven craftsmanship. Dwarvish runes on the axe head read "Hew," and the rust obscures its true nature. Hew is a +1 battleaxe that deals maximum damage when used against plant creatures or wooden objects. The axe's creator, a dwarf smith, had a long-standing feud with the forest's dryads, from whom he gathered firewood. Anyone wielding this axe feels discomfort while traversing a forest.

#### Awarding Experinece Points

Divide 2,000 XP evenly among the characters if they succeed in driving Venomfang away. While slaying the dragon at their current level is unlikely, the creature is worth 3,900 XP.

### **8. The Abandoned Smithy**

This smithy was abandoned many years ago.

```
Indications of its past functionality include a wide chimney and untidy woodpiles outside the walls.
```

Upon entering, two ash zombies (refer to the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) sprawl on the floor. As the characters step inside, the zombies laboriously rise to their feet, using half their speed to do so. They then relentlessly assault the intruders, regardless of their movements. The building is scattered with various old tools like tongs, bellows, hammers, and a pair of iron anvils.

#### Awarding Experience Points

For experience points, divide 100 XP equally among the characters if the party successfully defeats the ash zombies.

### **9. The Herbalist's Shop**

In the past, this establishment served as an herb and alchemy shop owned by Mirna Dendrar's family, who now resides in Phandalin (see encounter 5 in the "Redbrand Hideout" section).

```
The ruined shop is replete with dilapidated storage shelves and broken furniture. Among the weeds and rubble, you'll spot fragments of glass and pottery, alongside decaying books and casks.
```

All the reagents and mixtures have long perished, and the books are now indecipherable masses of decay. However, a small wooden case can be found hidden beneath a compartment beneath the storage shelves. A character conducting a thorough search through the wreckage may uncover the case with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The check is automatically successful if Mirna dispatched the party to retrieve the heirloom.

#### Treasure

As for the treasure, the case itself has no value but safeguards a gold necklace with an exquisite emerald pendant, valued at 200 gp.

### **10. The Town Square**

The square remains free from encroaching underbrush.

```
At the eastern side of the town, a lane expands, creating a modest square. The southern edge of the square is encircled by several dilapidated buildings, while to the north, a larger, well-preserved structure resembling a barracks stands. Three paths diverge: one leads southeast, another curves southwest around the central hill, and a third meanders north. At the square's center, slightly leaning, a time-worn wooden statue of a warrior gripping a spear and shield catches the eye.
```

This ten-foot-tall, base included, statue honors an old Neverwinter hero named Palien, who, as legends tell, vanquished numerous creatures in Neverwinter Wood during Thundertree's earliest days. A character who studies the statue can identify the depiction with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. If one wishes, the statue can be toppled with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

### **11. The Old Garrison**

For the Thundertree residents, their proximity to the Neverwinter Wood demanded constant vigilance.

```
The barracks appears to have weathered the years better than most town buildings. A simple battlement crowns its rooftop, and arrow-slit windows confirm its intended use as a small keep during emergencies.
```

Five ash zombies, former members of the garrison, still wear tattered remnants of rusted mail and soldier's surcoats, though these scraps do not enhance their Armor Class. The zombies rouse and attack any living creature that disturbs their rest.

Furnishings are still found within the building, including a ladder in the main room leading to the roof. The northern chamber contains two double bunks, while the southern chamber holds three double bunks, offering accommodations for ten soldiers in total. To the northwest, a kitchen and pantry now hold piles of decayed sacks and barrels that once stored salted meat. However, vermin have long since devoured all the foodstuffs.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Divide 250 XP equally among the characters if the party eliminates the ash zombies.

### **12. The Weaver's Cottage**

This fallen cottage serves as a lure for the nearby lairing creatures, attracting heaps of wreckage inside.

```
Large heaps of wreckage are visible within the ruin. In one corner stands a shattered loom.
```

Six twig blights skulk in the thicket south of the ruin. Allow each character to attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check, contested by the blights' Dexterity (Stealth) check, to avoid being taken by surprise.

Notably, any loud noises in this area will alert the cultists in area 13, who will proceed cautiously to investigate.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party eradicates the twig blights.

### **13. Dragon Cultists**

A faction known as the Cult of the Dragon seeks to forge alliances with the mighty dragons of the Sword Coast. To achieve this, four cultists have recently tracked a green dragon to Thundertree (see area 7) and await the opportune moment to approach the dragon and negotiate an alliance. They have been spying on the dragon from a distance, attempting to gauge its disposition and requirements.

```
Initially, this small farmhouse may appear as another uninhabited dwelling. However, all doors are shut, and windows remain shuttered.
```

The cottage's doors are securely barred from the inside, demanding a successful DC 20 Strength check to forcibly open. Similarly, the shutters are barred from within, and they can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Inside the house, six human cultists are hidden. Four of them stand guard, with two in each room, while the rest rest in the larger chamber. These cultists wear black cloaks fashioned to resemble dragon wings and don black leather masks with stylized dragon horns. They are fluent in Common as well as Draconic.

The interior of the house is dusty and draped with cobwebs. The sole furnishings include a small stove, a table, two chairs, and a shared bunk for the cultists.

#### Roleplaying the Cultists

The cultists harbor no interest in engaging in combat and would rather be left undisturbed. The group's leader is Favric, an evil and ambitious young man aspiring to ascend the ranks quickly by securing the allegiance of the green dragon in area 7. His fellow cultists lack Favric's ambition and will flee if he is captured or killed.

If the characters decide to converse with the cultists, Favric explains that they have come to negotiate with the green dragon (whose name he doesn't know). If the characters express a similar interest, Favric suggests forming an alliance. However, his true intent is to offer the characters as tribute to the dragon, and if a conflict arises, the cultists side with the dragon.

#### Treasure

Favric keeps a small coffer in the main room, containing tribute for the green dragon: three diamonds (valued at 100 gp each). He also carries a potion of flying in a stoppered vial around his neck.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party successfully defeats or drives away the cultists.

## Wyvern Tor

Wyvern Tor, a prominent landmark in the rugged hills northeast of the Sword Mountains, is visible from up to twenty miles away. Travelers along the Triboar Trail near Conyberry catch glimpses of Wyvern Tor to the south. In the past, Wyvern Tor was home to a formidable nest of wyverns, but years ago, a brave group of adventurers eradicated the creatures. While the wyverns have never returned, other creatures occasionally take up residence here. The current occupants of Wyvern Tor include a band of orcs and their ogre ally.

The orcs are scouts from the Many Arrows tribe and are often found prowling the more civilized regions of the North. They engage in spying on human settlements, ambushing travelers, and looting when opportunities present themselves. Stories of new settlers near Phandalin and increased activity along the old Triboar Trail drew this group to the area. Their leader is Brughor Axe-Biter, a savage brute more inclined toward murder and looting than scouting.

### Orc Camp

Wyvern Tor is a sizable hill with rugged terrain across its slopes and flanks. Locating the hidden orc camp takes time. The party can attempt one DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check per hour to find the camp, led by the character taking the lead.

Once the characters find the camp, describe the following:

```
As you ascend a rugged ridge on the lower slopes of the hill, a faint smell of smoke lingers in the air. About fifty yards away, a cave entrance opens at the base of a ravine. Hunkered down by a boulder twenty yards outside the cave, keeping watch, is a solitary orc.
```

If the characters can quietly and efficiently eliminate the lone orc, they have the chance to surprise the orcs inside the cave. If the sentry spots the characters sneaking up or is not silenced during the surprise round, the orc will retreat back into the cave to warn the others.

The marauders within the cave consist of Brughor Axe-Biter (an orc with 30 hit points), six ordinary orcs, and a filthy ogre named Gog. Gog fights until slain, while the orcs fight until Brughor is killed, at which point any remaining orcs will flee.

#### Treasure

Brughor's band plundered several homesteads to the north on their way to Wyvern Tor. In the cave, an unlocked treasure chest holds 750 copper pieces, 180 silver pieces, 62 electrum pieces, 30 gold pieces, and three vials of perfume (each worth 10 gp).

#### Awarding Experience Points

For experience points, completing the quest and fulfilling a promise from Old Owl Well, divide 1,250 XP equally among the characters if the party handles the orcs and the ogre at Wyvern Tor.

## **Cragmaw Castle**

The Cragmaw tribe consists of marauding bands and rival goblin strongholds scattered throughout the region encompassing the Triboar Trail and the Neverwinter Wood. Nevertheless, one chieftain reluctantly acknowledged by all others as supreme is King Grol, who resides in Cragmaw Castle.

Cragmaw Castle is not the work of goblins, nor is that its original name. Constructed by a skilled wizard-noble of ancient Phalorm, a once-dominant realm in the North, this stronghold comprises seven interconnected towers, although its upper stories have long since succumbed to decay, forming heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor remains stable enough for habitation.

**General Features**

The centuries have not treated Cragmaw Castle kindly. The goblins have attempted to fortify the weakest areas beneath its collapsing towers with crude timbers, but it's merely a matter of time before the entire structure collapses.

* **Ceilings.** Ceilings are 15 feet high unless otherwise noted.
* **Doors.** Interior doors consist of wood reinforced with iron bands and lack locks or keyholes. A successful DC 15 Strength check is needed to force open a door barricaded shut.
* **Floors.** Cracked and uneven flagstones conceal a dirt floor underneath.

 **Light.**  A minimal amount of natural light filters through the arrow slits around the castle, providing dim light in most areas during the day. At night, all areas are dark.

 **Walls.**  Exterior walls and load-bearing interior walls measure 5 feet thick, featuring 3 feet of mortared fill between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior walls are 1-foot-thick worked stone. Arrow slits in the castle walls are situated 10 feet above the outside ground level, 4 feet above the interior floor level, measuring 8 inches in width and 4 feet in height. A creature on one side of an arrow slit gains three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side.

### **1. Castle Entrance**

The primary gates that separate areas 1 and 2 are constructed of bronze-covered wood, but they have corroded and collapsed.

```
The castle comprises seven deteriorating towers of varying sizes and heights, with the upper stories in various states of collapse. A brief flight of steps leads to a terrace before the main entrance. Beyond the remains of two broken doors lies a dimly lit hall. Round towers loom over the entrance, boasting dark arrow slits that oversee the terrace.
```

No monsters currently occupy this area, although goblin sentries in area 3 are tasked with keeping watch. However, they peer out of the arrow slits only occasionally, so characters who move stealthily might have the opportunity to slip past them. Each character should make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, with the lowest check representing the DC for the goblins' Wisdom checks to notice the party.

#### **Developments**

If the goblins spot the characters (or if the characters approach openly), the goblins will launch arrows from behind the arrow slits. However, they cannot shoot directly at foes at or beyond the broken gate. The goblins will also loudly shout, which is enough to alert their comrades in areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.

```
**Disguised Characters**

Instead of assaulting Cragmaw Castle, clever characters might attempt to gain entry through diplomacy. For example, they could don scarlet cloaks resembling those of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by Iarno "Glasstaff" Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. The Dungeon Master may reward this sort of cunning with an opportunity for success. It is acceptable if the characters bypass combat by talking their way past the castle defenders, as both the Cragmaw tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, making it unlikely that the goblinoids will attack the party if they assert that they are acting in the Black Spider's interest. If the characters attempt to deceive the monsters as a group, have each character make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the monsters' Wisdom (Insight) checks. Award XP for any monsters deceived by the ruse. Additional checks may be required as the party proceeds deeper into the castle.
```

### **2. Trapped Hall**

Once a grand foyer, this wide hall has now turned into a treacherous battleground.

```
Doors to the north and south are closed, with a pile of crumbling rubble partially obscuring the southern passage. To the east, a broad corridor ends in two more doors leading south and east. The corridor is cluttered with dusty debris and fallen plaster due to a partial ceiling collapse.
```

Should the goblin sentries in area 3 have raised the alarm, the goblins and hobgoblins in areas 4 and 6 will quickly rush out from the north and south doors simultaneously. They will attempt to attack from both directions, aiming to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them out of the castle.

 **Trap.** Dusty plaster and rubble in front of the door leading to area 8 conceal a copper tripwire connected to linchpins hidden in the ruined ceiling. Detecting the tripwire requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 20, or a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check when actively searching for traps in the area. Once spotted, the tripwire can be easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).

Anyone who steps over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire will trigger a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. (The area of the collapse is marked on the map.) Any creature within the area when the trap triggers must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from falling debris (half damage on a successful save). The noise from the collapse puts the monsters in areas 3, 7, 8, and 9 on high alert.

 **Awarding Experience Points.** Divide 100 XP equally among the characters if the party detects or survives the trap.

### **3. Archer Post**

Cragmaw Castle's primary defenses rely on its concealed location and the appearance of abandonment. Additionally, King Grol stations sentries to repel intruders who venture too close.

```
This small room is strewn with debris. The arrow slit opposite the door provides a clear field of fire over the terrace in front of the castle gates.
```

Two goblins occupy each of these two rooms. They take turns firing arrows and withdrawing, enabling both archers to shoot each round at targets outside. When characters enter the room, the goblins will drop their shortbows and draw their melee weapons.

 **Awarding Experience Points.** Divide 100 XP equally among the characters for each pair of goblin archers the party defeats.

### **4. Ruined Barracks**

The Cragmaw goblins are resourceful and use every available inch of space within the castle.

```
In the southwest tower of the castle, what remains is mostly rubble. Several tattered bedrolls are strewn across the remaining floor area, and a narrow, twisting passage extends eastward through the debris.
```

This chamber houses three goblins, and despite the rubble appearing treacherous, the tower is surprisingly stable, and the eastern passage is safe.

#### **Developments**

Any loud commotion in this area draws the attention of the goblins in area 7. One goblin will come to inspect the disturbance. If it fails to return or detects trouble and sounds the alarm, the others will investigate.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party overcomes these goblins.

### **5. Storeroom**

The Cragmaws have been raiding caravans along the High Road and the Triboar Trail to stockpile provisions for the castle.

```
Old casks of salted meat and sacks of decaying grain fill this storage space. Among the supplies, you see a bloodied suit of chain mail, a heavy crossbow, and a drawn longsword bearing the emblem of Neverwinter on its hilt. While the stored goods here are inedible by human standards, the goblins can endure them when fresher food is unavailable.
```

One small cask contains an exceptional dwarven brandy, overlooked by the goblins due to its size. The cask holds the equivalent of twenty servings. Consuming a glass of this brandy restores 1 hit point, but drinking two glasses within an hour results in being poisoned for one hour.

**Sildar's Gear.** The chain mail and longsword belong to Sildar Hallwinter. Sildar will be appreciative if at least his longsword is returned to him.

### **6. Hobgoblin Barracks**

The Cragmaws are a mixed tribe of goblinoids, with a few bugbears dominating larger numbers of miserable goblins and a handful of hobgoblins. The hobgoblins aspire to eliminate the bugbears and seize control someday, but for now, the bugbears present too significant a threat.

```
Four plain straw pallets and bedrolls are arranged on the floor of this barracks. Brackets on the walls hold an assortment of weapons, including spears, swords, morningstars, and more. The north wall displays signs of damage, but the floor is free from debris.
```

This room accommodates four hobgoblins who, due to the constant brawls among their goblin neighbors, tend to disregard noise from areas 2 or 3. However, they are quick to defend their tower if any intruders appear or to respond to an alarm raised by the goblin sentries.

#### **Treasure**

Mounted on the walls are five spears, four longswords, three morningstars, two greatswords, and a finely crafted quarterstaff. The quarterstaff is engraved with stylized feathers, surprisingly light (11 pounds), and valued at 10 gp.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the hobgoblins in this room.

### **7. Banquet Hall**

Once a place of grand feasts and celebrations hosted by the castle's lord, this chamber now serves as a wretched goblin mess hall.

```
The western portion of this expansive hall terminates in a rubble-strewn wall, but the remainder remains intact. This must have been the castle's grand banquet hall, featuring a lofty 25-foot ceiling. Two large wooden tables with plain benches are situated in the center of the room, and a brass brazier filled with glowing coals is tucked into one corner. The tables are strewn with dirty dishes, half-empty stew pots, moldy bread remnants, and gnawed bones.
```

This hall is inhabited by seven miserable goblins and their leader, a corpulent, irritable goblin named Yegg, who possesses 12 hit points. Yegg is the Cragmaw's head cook, cruelly bossing around his unwilling assistants as they prepare food for the tribe. If Yegg is eliminated, any surviving goblins will flee to the east or west, avoiding the north door due to the trap in area 2.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party overcomes the goblins in this room.

### **8. Shadowed Chapel**

Even in daylight, this chamber remains shrouded in darkness. The following text assumes that the characters possess darkvision or a light source.

```
This narrow, lofty hall appears to have served as a chapel or shrine long ago. Angelic figures are sculpted into the upper reaches of the room, gazing down upon the floor below. To the north, heavy curtains obscure a pair of matching archways. Between these archways stands a cracked yet ornately carved stone brazier.
```

Within this chamber resides a grick, the personal pet of the goblin Lhupo from area 9. The grick takes pleasure in climbing up to a hidden ledge concealed in the shadows amidst the statuary in the upper reaches of the room. It silently observes intruders entering the area before suddenly dropping to strike. Determine who among the party is caught by surprise by comparing the grick's Dexterity (Stealth) check to the characters' Wisdom (Perception) checks or their passive perception scores. The grick refrains from attacking goblins, as they are not to be consumed without Lhupo's consent.

Other Cragmaws are deeply apprehensive of Lhupo's pet and swiftly cross this room, preferably in small groups. Any cleric who examines the chapel's decorations may attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to identify the deities once revered here: Oghma (god of knowledge), Mystra (goddess of magic), Lathander (god of dawn), and Tymora (goddess of luck). This suggests that the castle's builders were human.

#### **Developments**

If combat breaks out here, the goblins in area 9 cannot be taken by surprise.

#### **Treasure**

The stone brazier conceals a mound of coal, beneath which rests a gold statuette of a sun elf (worth 100 gp) swathed in crimson fabric. A goblin concealed the figurine here in the hope that their fellow goblins would not pilfer it.

A detect magic spell will reveal that the statuette is imbued with divination magic. When held by any non-evil creature, the figurine can be used to ask a question, receiving a telepathic response as though the caster had employed augury (consult the rulebook for this spell's description). Once a creature has asked its question and received a response, the statuette can never be activated again.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 450 XP equally among the characters if the party conquers the grick.

### **9. Goblin Shrine**

The Cragmaws have rededicated this area to Maglubiyet, the goblin and hobgoblin god, as goblins have no use for human deities.

```
This room, located within the northern tower of the castle, is dominated by a stone altar standing in its center, draped with bloodstained black cloth. On top of the altar, you find carefully arranged golden ritual implements, including a chalice, a knife, and a censer. Heavy curtains shroud two archways to the south.
```

This shrine is presided over by Lhupo, a goblin boasting 12 hit points, and two ordinary goblins who act as his "acolytes." Though they don filthy robes over their armor, none of them possess actual divine powers, even though Lhupo claims to hear Maglubiyet communicating with him. In case the goblins heard the party fighting the gricks in area 8, they will hide behind the altar and attempt to spring a surprise attack on the intruders. If not, the three goblins kneel before the altar, deep in prayer to their malevolent god.

The bloodstained cloth fully envelops the stone altar, with engravings of the same deities depicted in the décor of area 8 on its sides.

#### **Treasure**

The golden chalice, knife, and censer are human-crafted art objects worth 150 gp, 60 gp, and 120 gp, respectively.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party vanquishes the goblins.

### **10. Postern Gate**

This side entrance to the castle is securely locked and unguarded.

```
Located on the south side of the old castle, an overgrown path leads to a passageway that ascends into the wall. An imposing iron door stands here, protected from direct attacks from outside. Arrow slits positioned ten feet above ground level overlook the path.
```

The iron door is locked, but it can be unlocked with the aid of thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or simply forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength check.

**Arrow Slits.** If any character stops to listen near the arrow slits, they will hear occasional clattering noises from area 7. These sounds suggest goblins quarreling over cleaning dishes. The goblins are not keeping a watch through these arrow slits. However, if the party makes a considerable racket or disturbance, such as breaking down the door, the goblins will come to investigate. If they spot intruders outside, they will raise an alarm.

### **12. Guardian Barracks**

The creatures in this room maintain a vigilant watch through the arrow slits. Therefore, any characters attempting to move stealthily around the east side of the castle are at risk of being detected and subsequently attacked.

```
A stone brazier filled with burning coals radiates warmth at the center of this small barracks. Four straw pallets are arranged along the eastern wall. The southern wall has collapsed, yet a barred wooden door leading in that direction remains accessible. A curtain drapes across a northern archway.
```

In this chamber, two hobgoblin sentinels stand guard. These hobgoblins are sharp, tenacious, and fiercely loyal to King Grol. At the start of a skirmish, one of the hobgoblins dashes off to alert King Grol in area 14 and returns to rejoin the battle two rounds later.

Once a parlor for the castle's human occupants, this area now displays the remnants of rotted furnishings, which were broken up by the Cragmaws and repurposed for firewood.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party overcomes the hobgoblins.

### 13. Owlbear Tower

The entrance to this room is secured by a massive wooden bar, serving as an ominous warning of potential danger beyond. When the bar is lifted, the creature dwelling inside stirs and unleashes a fearsome roar.

 The arrow slits in this room are closed off, casting the chamber into darkness. The following description assumes that the characters have access to darkvision or a source of illumination.

```
The upper levels of this tower have crumbled, creating a vast, hollow silo reaching a height of at least thirty feet, with the upper portions of the room disappearing into obscurity. The floor is strewn with debris, dust, and shards of broken glass. Along the southern wall, old worktables and bookshelves lie in disarray. In the room's center stands a monstrous creature resembling a mangy bear with the head of an owl, rearing up and bellowing as it spots the intruders.
```

The Cragmaws have captured an owlbear and confined it within this tower. The room is intentionally kept dark to prevent the creature from becoming agitated, but King Grol is uncertain about what to do with it. If a character tosses fresh meat to the owlbear, it will devour the offering. However, if not provided with sustenance, it attacks the first being it perceives in the doorway.

Once serving as a library and workshop, this room now lacks any trace of its original contents.

#### **Developments**

If the characters open the door and remain out of the owlbear's path, it will flee the castle, most likely through area 11. The owlbear will attack anything obstructing its escape.

#### **Treasure**

All that remains of the tower's second level is a jagged ledge, on which rests a battered wooden chest. The chest is inconspicuous from the floor and requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to be spotted. It is unlocked and contains 90 ep, 120 gp, a potion of healing, a scroll of silence, and a scroll of revivify.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 700 XP equally among the characters if the party subdues the owlbear or releases it.

#### **14. King's Quarters**

When a character listens at the door, they discern the sounds of two voices locked in a heated conversation. One voice, a growling and assertive tone, demands payment for something, while the other responds in a silky, smooth manner.

```
This chamber has been crudely arranged as a living space, with thick furs serving as makeshift carpets, ancient trophies adorning the walls, and a large bed situated in the north. A brazier filled with glowing coals emits a warm light. To the south of the room stands a round table surrounded by several chairs. Near the table, on the floor, lies an unconscious and severely beaten dwarf.
```

King Grol, an elderly yet formidable bugbear with 45 hit points, presides over the Cragmaws through sheer force and intimidation. Though age has bent his shoulders and stooped his back, his agility and strength are still impressive. Grol is relentless and unforgiving, and none of the Cragmaw tribe dare cross him.

Grol is accompanied by Snarl, a wolf with 18 hit points, and a doppelganger posing as a female drow. This doppelganger, Vyerith, serves as a messenger from the Black Spider and has come to obtain Gundren Rockseeker and the map to Wave Echo Cave from King Grol. However, Grol is more inclined to sell the map rather than hand it over, leading to negotiations between him and the drow. Vyerith initially wishes to question Gundren to ascertain if anyone else possesses knowledge of the mine's location before planning to eliminate the dwarf and destroy the map.

In the event that the villains have been forewarned of an impending attack, Vyerith conceals herself behind the northeastern door, leaving it slightly ajar in anticipation of ambushing intruders from behind. King Grol holds Gundren as a hostage and is prepared to execute the dwarf if the characters don't withdraw.

**Arrow Slits.** The arrow slits are located 15 feet above ground level outside, and the occupants within are not actively keeping watch. Consequently, they are unlikely to detect intruders moving around the exterior of the castle.

**Northwest Room.** This partly collapsed room once functioned as a luxurious bathroom, with a large tile bathtub still intact but unused by the present inhabitants.

**Unconscious Dwarf.** In the southwestern corner of the room lies Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf commoner, unconscious and stable at 0 hit points.

#### **Developments**

If King Grol is defeated, Vyerith will attempt to eliminate Gundren and escape with the map, heading toward area 11 and making her exit through the concealed canvas door. If cornered, the doppelganger will fight to the death rather than be captured.

Should Gundren regain consciousness, he expresses his gratitude to the party for coming to his rescue but insists on not leaving Cragmaw Castle without his map. Unfortunately, he is unaware of King Grol's map's hiding place, as detailed in the "Treasure" section.

#### **Treasure**

Concealed beneath Grol's bed mattress is a sewn leather sack containing 220 sp, 160 ep, three potions of healing, and Gundren's map to Wave Echo Cave.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 950 XP equally among the characters if they overcome King Grol, the wolf, and the doppelganger.

Provide an additional 200 XP to the party if they successfully rescue Gundren Rockseeker and accompany him safely back to Phandalin.

### **Returning War Band**

As an additional twist, you can introduce a complication in the form of a hobgoblin war band returning to the castle as the characters are preparing to depart. This war band is composed of three hobgoblins led by Targor Bloodsword, a hobgoblin with 20 hit points. Targor is accompanied by two pet wolves.

These hobgoblins possess no treasure, but 1d4 of them carry bloodied sacks, each containing a severed elf head. These severed heads serve as trophies from the recent triumph of the hobgoblins over an elf hunting party.

Clever characters might attempt to reason with Targor by encouraging him to regard himself as Grol's successor rather than his avenger. Targor has long aspired to lead the Cragmaw tribe, and thus, he may refrain from killing the adventurers, provided one or more characters can achieve a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Divide 500 XP equally among the characters if they conquer the hobgoblin war band or negotiate a truce with Targor.

### **What's Next?**

Should Gundren Rockseeker survive his ordeal in Cragmaw Castle, he expresses his gratitude to the party and requests that they accompany him back to Phandalin. He further urges the characters to embark on a quest to Wave Echo Cave to determine the fate of his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. Gundren is aware that an individual known as the Black Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the adventurers will thwart the antagonist's plans. Upon their return to Phandalin, Gundren rewards the characters with 25 gp each for their assistance and promises them a 10 percent share of the mine's wealth once his operation there is operational.

With the revelation of the location of Wave Echo Cave, the characters are now prepared to set forth in search of the ancient dwarven mine. Their objective is to uncover the identity of the Black Spider and ascertain the reasons behind the villain's intense interest in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.
