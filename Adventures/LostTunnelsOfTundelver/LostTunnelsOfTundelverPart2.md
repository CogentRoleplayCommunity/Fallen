# **Part 2: Tuntin**

Phandalin, a frontier town, is perched atop the remnants of a much older settlement. Centuries ago, the former Phandalin thrived as a bustling human town, firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same horde of marauders who plundered the mines at Wave Echo Cave razed the settlement, causing Phandalin to be abandoned and left in ruins for ages.

Over the past three or four years, resilient settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep embarked on the challenging mission of resurrecting the Phandalin of old. Out of these efforts, a thriving frontier town now stands, attracting a diverse array of inhabitants such as farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors, all enticed by tales of gold and platinum hidden within the nearby foothills of the Sword Mountains.

Regrettably, the lack of a local lord or authority to maintain order has also drawn its share of bandits and brigands. For the past two months, a gang known as the Redbrands has held sway over Phandalin, intimidating and coercing the town's populace. The gang's enigmatic leader is a figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.

Upon the characters' initial arrival in Phandalin, present the following scene:

```
Your journey along the rutted track reveals the first glimpse of Phandalin. The town comprises around forty to fifty modest log buildings, some of which rest on ancient fieldstone foundations. The newer structures encircle the town's outskirts, intermingled with remnants of old ruinsâ€”crumbling stone walls now adorned with ivy and entwined in briars. These remnants are a testament to Phandalin's grandeur during past centuries.

Most of the contemporary buildings flank the cart track, which expands into a somewhat muddy main street as it ascends toward a dilapidated manor house situated on the eastern hillside of the town. As you draw near, you observe children at play on the town green, while townsfolk are preoccupied with their daily tasks, darting to and from shops. Many eyes briefly rise to acknowledge your presence but then return to their duties as you pass by.
```

If Sildar Hallwinter accompanies the party, add:

```
Sildar appears visibly more relaxed.

"My friends," he comments, "let's secure lodgings. I hear the local inn is quite charming."
```

Sildar's intention is to obtain some rest at the Stonehill Inn and subsequently launch an investigation throughout Phandalin in search of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his inquiry reaches an impasse, he organizes a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the "Townmaster's Hall" section).

Throughout this phase of the adventure, the characters have the liberty to explore various locations in Phandalin and engage with the NPCs they encounter (see the "Town Description" section for more information). The town is small enough that one can traverse its length within a few minutes. However, given that the characters arrive late in the day, they won't have enough time to visit more than one or two locations before they must seek accommodations for the night.

Among the places the characters should consider visiting are:

**Barthen's Provisions.** If the characters bear the wagonload of supplies from the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, they are directed to deliver it to this establishment.

**Lionshield Coster.** If the characters have retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they may wish to return them to their rightful owner.

**Stonehill Inn.** If Sildar Hallwinter accompanies the party, he recommends heading to this inn to secure lodgings. If the characters are in search of a place to dine and rest, they will find that the Stonehill Inn offers the best available options.

## Encounters in Tuntin

As the characters explore the town of Phandalin, you don't need to meticulously account for the time spent at each location. Instead, envision yourself as the director of an old-style western movie. Your aim is to depict various scenes where the adventurers enter a store or saloon and interact with the individuals present. Through these interactions, the adventurers uncover what the NPCs require or what information they are willing to share, allowing them to move on to the next location. These scenes represent a series of role-playing encounters that take place over a couple of days of in-game time.

To initiate, inquire where the players wish to go and what they intend to do in town. You might say, "There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores, and trading posts, along with a few other residences and businesses. Where would you like to visit?" Once the players have selected a location, reference the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs present, and initiate the interaction.

**The Stonehill Inn.** If the players are unsure about their characters' next steps, encourage them to commence at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs here serve as guides, steering the characters towards various adventure opportunities and essential rumors accessible in other parts of the town. By patronizing the inn, the characters gain insight into other places they should explore.

**Redbrand Ruffians.** Sooner or later, the adventurers will cross paths with the toughs who dominate Phandalin. Your role is to determine when these ruffians make their appearance. Once the characters have had an opportunity to explore several locations in town and converse with the townsfolk, they may decide to track down the Redbrands. In such an event, you can execute the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters seem hesitant to confront the ruffians, the Redbrands may decide to seek them out at a moment of your choosing.

**Finding Cragmaw Castle.** The characters may express a desire to locate Cragmaw Castle to rescue Gundren Rockseeker. The majority of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town possesses knowledge of Cragmaw Castle's whereabouts. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can provide guidance on how the party might connect with someone who possesses knowledge about the castle's location.

## Important NPCs

Here is a brief summary of the most important NPCs in Phandalin and their relevance to the adventure:

1. **Toblen Stonehill (Innkeeper):** The proprietor of the Stonehill Inn, a central location in Phandalin where adventurers can gather information and secure lodging.
2. **Elmar Barthen (Trading Post Owner):** Operates a trading post and owes money to the party if you are using the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook.
3. **Daran Edermath (Order of the Gauntlet Member):** A member of the Order of the Gauntlet who has a quest for the party, providing an opportunity for adventurers to become involved in the order's activities.
4. **Linene Graywind (Trader):** Operates a trading post and offers a reward for retrieving her stolen supplies, motivating the party to engage with the town's troubles.
5. **Halia Thornton (Zhentarim Member):** A member of the Zhentarim with a quest for the party, introducing intrigue and opportunities to work with or against this faction.
6. **Qelline Alderleaf (Helpful Halfling Farmer):** A kind-hearted halfling farmer whose son, Carp, possesses knowledge of a secret entrance into the Redbrands' hideout, potentially aiding the party's efforts to deal with this troublesome gang.
7. **Sister Garaele (Elf Cleric of Tymora):** An elf cleric of Tymora and Harper agent with a quest for the party, furthering the adventurers' involvement with the Harper organization.
8. **Harbin Wester (Townmaster of Phandalin):** The townmaster of Phandalin who provides a quest for the party, prompting them to engage in town governance and security.
9. **Sildar Hallwinter (Lords' Alliance Member):** A member of the Lords' Alliance who offers two quests for the party, linking them with this influential faction and the search for the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek.

### Roleplaying Phandalin NPCs

If you're uncertain about how to portray an NPC, a great way to begin is to have the character introduce themselves, extend a warm welcome to the adventurers as they enter Phandalin, and inquire about their identities and intentions. You don't need to be a professional actor or a stand-up comedian to breathe life into your NPCs. However, if you'd like to add some flair, here are some helpful tips:

* **Relax:** Don't stress about impressing your players with your acting skills or humor. A natural portrayal of the character is often more engaging.
* **Understanding the NPCs:** Put yourself in the shoes of the NPCs. Consider how they might react to the characters and aim for realism in your responses.
* **Physical Expressions:** Utilize physical gestures and expressions to make your NPCs more vibrant. You can frown, grin, sneer, bat your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, or use other suitable body language to bring your NPCs to life.
* **Variety of Voices:** Experiment with different voices and speech patterns for your NPCs. You can draw inspiration from real-life accents, movie characters, or TV personalities. Adjust the volume and tone as needed to match the character's personality.
* **Player-Led Interactions:** Allow the players to take the lead in their interactions with the NPCs. This empowers them to shape the conversation and ask questions, promoting their engagement in the story.
* **Keep things moving:** It's important to note that the characters should have no reason to engage in combat with ordinary townsfolk. As a result, there's no need to provide game statistics for them. In the rare event that statistics become necessary, the commoner stat block can represent an adult NPC of any race.

## **Description of Phandalin**

Phandalin is a small town, which means the characters can explore various locations and interact with different NPCs throughout a single day. If the players decide to split up their characters, they can cover more ground, but you'll need to take turns managing interactions for each player. It's important to be aware that splitting the party can increase the potential danger of the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.

The subsequent sections provide specific details about various locations within the town.

### Stonehill Inn

```
At the heart of Phandalin stands a recently constructed roadhouse made of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. Inside, the common room buzzes with locals enjoying mugs of ale or cider, their curious eyes following your arrival.
```

This unassuming inn provides six rooms for rent, with one already occupied by Sildar Hallwinter. If the characters opt to stay at the Stonehill Inn, you can reference the "Food, Drink, and Lodging" section in the rulebook for pricing. Alternatively, they could camp outside of town or attempt to secure lodgings with farmers like Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf.

The innkeeper is a friendly, short young human named Toblen Stonehill. Originally from the town of Triboar to the east, he came to Phandalin seeking mining opportunities. However, he soon discovered his true calling was innkeeping. Toblen holds mixed feelings about the Redbrands' reign of terror in the town and the lack of action from the townmaster, Harbin Wester. Despite his concerns, he refrains from stirring up trouble to protect his wife and children from potential Redbrand retaliation.

**Rumors at Stonehill Inn.** In the common room of the inn, characters can gather several useful leads by mingling with the townspeople and striking up conversations. The rumors circulating within the Stonehill Inn include:

* Narth, an elderly farmer, shares that "Sister Garaele, the overseer of the Shrine of Luck, recently returned to town, injured and fatigued."
* Elsa, a talkative barmaid, reveals that "Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer."
* Lanar, a miner, reports that "Ore raiders have been sighted at the east end of Triboar Trail, and the town master is searching for someone to handle the situation."
* Trilena, the innkeeper's wife, discloses the tragic story of Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver who confronted the Redbrands and was subsequently murdered. She also reveals that Thel's family has gone missing. Unbeknownst to Trilena and the townsfolk, the Redbrands have taken Thel's wife and children to their hidden hideout.
* Pip, Toblen's young son, recounts Carp, Qelline Alderleaf's son, who discovered a secret tunnel in the woods, barely escaping the Redbrands' pursuit.
* Freda, a weaver, mentions that the Redbrands harass all the businesses in town, except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange, as they don't want to provoke Halia Thornton, who runs it.

These rumors serve as valuable clues, guiding the characters toward various adventure opportunities in Phandalin. Furthermore, any of the inn's patrons can inform the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house on the town's eastern end, emphasizing the danger posed by these ruffians.

### **Barthen's Provisions**

Barthen's Provisions is the largest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves are stocked with a wide range of everyday goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The store is open from sunrise to sunset and does not carry weapons or armor, but adventurers can find other essential gear here, provided the items cost less than 25 gp. When it comes to pricing, you can refer to the "Adventuring Gear" section in the rulebook.

The shop's proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a kind and slim human male shopkeeper who is around fifty years old. He employs two young clerks, Ander and Thistle, who assist with loading and unloading wagons and attending to customers when Barthen is absent.

**Delivering the Supplies.** If the characters initiated the adventure with the "Meet Me in Phandalin" hook, their task is to deliver a wagon filled with supplies to Barthen's. Upon arrival, Barthen pays the agreed-upon amount of 10 gp to each character and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. Informed of Gundren Rockseeker's abduction, Barthen is deeply saddened and encourages the party to rescue the dwarf. He views Gundren as a friend and was enthusiastic about the prospect of uncovering the lost mine mentioned in the introduction. If the characters haven't already learned about the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who passes a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can provide information found in the first two paragraphs of the "Background" section.

Additionally, Barthen mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, have been camping outside of town. However, he hasn't seen them in the past ten days and anticipates their return to resupply at any moment. Unbeknownst to Barthen, Tharden has passed away, and Nundro is held captive within the mine.

**Barthen's News.** If the characters inquire about the state of business in Phandalin, Barthen mentions that the Redbrands are making life difficult for everyone. They are extorting local businesses and defying the authority of the townmaster. If the characters express a desire to take action, he informs them that the Redbrands are regular patrons at the Sleeping Giant tap house.

### Edermath Orchard

Daran Edermath, a retired adventurer, resides in a charming cottage adjacent to an apple orchard. He is a robust half-elf, over a century old with striking silver hair. Daran served as a marshal and herald in the lands of the Dragon Coast, located far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his place of origin.

Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, an organization dedicated to protecting others from the wrongdoings of evildoers. The Order is committed to maintaining vigilance, upholding justice, and ensuring retribution against those who seek to oppress or harm the innocent. Although he no longer actively serves the Order, Daran keeps a watchful eye on Phandalin's happenings. He readily exchanges information with fellow adventurers, particularly those who embody these virtues.

Daran expresses concern regarding the Redbrands and yearns for a group of adventurers to confront them. He believes it is time to challenge the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran discloses to the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house but also reveals that their primary safe house is beneath Tresendar Manor on the town's eastern fringe.

**Quest: Old Owl Trouble.** Daran has learned through the stories of prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is excavating the ruins known as Old Owl Well. Even more disconcerting, several prospectors have reported being chased away by undead entities in the area. Daran urges the characters to visit the ruins, which are a couple of days' march to the northeast of Phandalin. Their task is to determine who is behind this activity and their intentions. Daran's concern lies with the ruins, an ancient watchtower of the Netheril magical empire, and the potential danger dormant within. If the party decides to pursue this quest, consult the "Old Owl Well" section for further details.

#### Joining the Order of the Gauntlet

For characters who engage with the Redbrands and explore Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group, urging them to consider joining the Order of the Gauntlet. He targets those who align with the Order's values of honor and vigilance. If a character accepts, Daran bestows the title of Cheval upon them.

### Lionshield Coster

```
A wooden shield bearing a painted blue lion emblem hangs above the entrance of this unpretentious trading post.
```

This establishment belongs to the Lionshields, a merchant company headquartered in Yartar, over one hundred miles to the east. They supply finished goods to Phandalin and other smaller settlements in the region. Unfortunately, this particular outpost has suffered from bandit attacks. The most recent Lionshield caravan, destined for Phandalin, was waylaid and its cargo captured by Cragmaw goblins.

The head of the Phandalin post is Linene Graywind, a sharp-tongued human woman in her mid-thirties. Linene is aware of the banditry affecting Lionshield caravans but remains uncertain about the responsible parties.

In a back room, Linene maintains an inventory of armor and weapons available for sale to interested customers. Prices are detailed in the "Adventuring Gear" section in the rulebook. However, Linene has her principles and refuses to sell weapons to those she believes could threaten the town, including the Redbrands. She advises the characters to steer clear of the Sleeping Giant tap house.

**Recovered Goods.** If the characters successfully recover the stolen goods located in area 8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but revealed their whereabouts), Linene rewards them with 50 gp and pledges her assistance to the adventurers in any way possible.

### Phandalin Miner's Exchange

The Miner's Exchange operates as a trading post where local miners have their valuable discoveries weighed, measured, and compensated. In the absence of local governance, the exchange serves as an unofficial records office, recording claims to various streams and excavations throughout the region. While Phandalin isn't experiencing a full-scale gold rush, hidden wealth in nearby streams and valleys supports numerous independent prospectors.

The guildmaster is Halia Thornton, a determined and strategic human woman. Her aspirations extend beyond mere commerce, and she acts as a de facto governing authority within the town. Additionally, Halia is an agent of the Zhentarim, an influential organization aiming to exert clandestine control over the North by means of wealth and influence. Halia works progressively to assert her influence in Phandalin and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they avoid conflicting with her.

Halia is unaware of Cragmaw Castle's location but has heard rumors that the Redbrands employ a goblin minion. She suggests the goblin might hold information about the castle's whereabouts. She leverages this information to persuade the characters to help her deal with the Redbrands.

**Quest: Halia's Job Offer.** In the event that characters she deems controllable approach her, Halia discloses the Redbrands' disruptive influence in town. She explains that the ruffians frequently loiter at the Sleeping Giant tap house and have an operational base underneath Tresendar Manor on the town's eastern border. She offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, known as Glasstaff, and to secure any correspondence discovered in his quarters. Halia keeps her true intentions hidden, as she aims to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals her ulterior motives.

#### Joining the Zhentarim

Should the party successfully eliminate the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton takes the opportunity to approach specific members of the group and encourages them to consider joining the Zhentarim. She engages with those who share the Zhentarim's ambitions, which revolve around the pursuit of wealth and power. Even if the party completely dismantles the Redbrand gang, Halia may still make this offer with the intention of fostering allies and informants within the party. If a character agrees to join, Halia bestows upon them the title of Fang.

### Alderleaf Farm

Qelline Alderleaf, a wise and practical female halfling aged forty-five, is an astute farmer who seems to be privy to all the town's ongoings. She provides hospitable accommodation, offering the characters the option to stay in her hayloft if they prefer not to lodge at the Stonehill Inn.

**Carp's Tale.** Qelline's ten-year-old son, Carp, is a spirited and curious young halfling. Carp is captivated by the idea of becoming an adventurer and shares a fascinating story. He mentions that while he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor, he stumbled upon a concealed tunnel in a thicket. During his discovery, a couple of "big, menacing bandits" emerged from the tunnel, engaging with Redbrands in the vicinity. Thankfully, Carp managed to remain concealed from their view, but the situation was precarious. Carp believes that the bandits maintain a hidden lair beneath the old manor house. He can either guide the characters to the tunnel's entrance or provide them with directions. This tunnel leads directly to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.

**Quest: Reidoth the Druid.** Qelline and Reidoth, a druid, share a longstanding friendship. If Qelline deduces that the characters are in search of specific locations such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests they visit Reidoth for assistance since he possesses extensive knowledge of the land. Qelline informs the characters that Reidoth recently embarked on a journey to the Thundertree ruins, located just west of the Neverwinter Wood. These ruins are situated approximately fifty miles northwest of Phandalin. She provides detailed directions to help the characters locate this place. If the party pursues this quest, refer to the "Ruins of Thundertree" section for further information.

### Shrine of Luck

Phandalin's sole temple is a modest shrine constructed using stones collected from nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, the goddess of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is overseen by a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a fervent young elf who despairs of ever eradicating the Redbrands from Phandalin. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a widely distributed network of adventurers and spies committed to promoting equality and covertly opposing the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land with the goal of thwarting tyrants and any faction, government, or group that amasses excessive power. They come to the aid of the weak, the poor, and the oppressed, always advocating for their well-being. Sister Garaele regularly reports on local events to her superiors.

**Quest: The Banshee's Bargain.** Sister Garaele was recently assigned a sensitive mission by her superiors. Her task was to persuade a banshee known as Agatha to respond to a question concerning a spellbook. Sister Garaele visited Agatha in her lair, but the banshee refused to appear for her. To facilitate communication, Garaele seeks an intermediary who will offer Agatha a suitable giftâ€”a jeweled silver combâ€”and persuade the banshee to divulge information about the location of a spellbook that once belonged to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character capable of flattering Agatha's vanity might be able to secure the answer through this trade. She extends the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as compensation for their efforts. If the party decides to undertake this quest, refer to the "Conyberry and Agatha's Lair" section for more details.

#### Joining the Harpers

Should the party assist Sister Garaele in uncovering the fate of Bowgentle's spellbook, she privately approaches specific members of the group, encouraging them to consider joining the Harpers. She focuses on individuals who embody the network's values and express a desire to bring about positive change through information and secrecy. If a character chooses to join, Sister Garaele confers upon them the title of Watcher.

### The Sleeping Giant

This dilapidated tap house is a grimy and perilous watering hole situated at the end of Phandalin's main street. It's a favorite haunt of Redbrand thugs and is managed by a cantankerous female dwarf named Grista. If the characters decide to visit this establishment, initiate the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter.

### **The Town Master's Hall**

```
The town master's hall is a solid structure, adorned with sturdy stone walls, a sloping wooden roof, and a bell tower at the rear. A public notice, written in Common, is affixed to a board next to the front door. It announces, "REWARD - Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those willing to confront the orc threat should inquire within." The notice is stamped with the town's seal and features an inscrutable signature.
```

Phandalin does not have a functioning government, but the residents elect a town master annually. The town master serves as an arbiter in minor disputes and manages any essential records. The present town master is Harbin Wester, a rotund and pompous elderly human who works as a banker. However, he is entirely cowed by the Redbrands and dismisses them as "just a group of mercenaries, not much trouble, really."

The town master's hall includes a small yet functional jail in its cellar, featuring two cells. Harbin holds the keys to these cell doors.

**Quest: Ore Trouble.** Harbin seeks a group willing to venture east on the Triboar Trail, as travelers have reported issues with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor. He offers a 100 gp reward to any party capable of resolving the problem. For further details about this quest, consult "Wyvern Tor" on page 35.

**Quest: Finding Cragmaw Castle.** After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter takes up residence at the town master's hall. In his role as a representative of the Lords' Alliance, his aim is to restore law and order to Phandalin. He intends to locate the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and assist the Rockseeker brothers in bringing it back into operation, believing that this would foster prosperity in the region and civilize the town.

Sildar also encourages the characters to maintain pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers a 500 gp reward to the party if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or expel the tribe's chieftain. Sildar suggests that the party could find the castle by scouting the lands surrounding the Triboar Trail for further raiding parties (refer to "Wilderness Encounters" in the "Triboar Trail" section of part 3).

**Quest: Finding Iarno.** Upon questioning several locals, Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, another member of the Lords' Alliance, vanished while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor approximately two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar enlists the characters' help in investigating the manor and its surroundings to locate and retrieve Iarno, or whatever remains of him if something has befallen him. Sildar describes Iarno as "a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties."

Unknown to Sildar, Iarno established the Redbrands, became their leader, and adopted the alias Glasstaff to conceal his true identity (a moniker earned due to his glass staff). Upon discovering the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard apprehended and transported to Neverwinter to face judgment by higher authorities. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

#### **Joining the Lords' Alliance**

If the party successfully deals with the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers Iarno's deception, Sildar Hallwinter discreetly approaches certain members of the group, urging them to consider joining the Lords' Alliance. He engages with individuals who aspire to uphold civilization through proactive measures. If a character decides to join, Sildar Hallwinter confers upon them the title of Cloak.

### **Tresendar Manor**

More fortress than residence, Tresendar Manor stands at the eastern outskirts of town, positioned atop a low hill amid woods and thickets. Although the ancient manor has been abandoned for a long time, its cellars have been converted into a stronghold for the Redbrands. If the characters decide to investigate this location, they will find the entrance to the Redbrand hideout.

## **Redbrand Ruffians**

It's almost inevitable that a confrontation with the Redbrands occurs within a day or two of the adventurers' arrival in Phandalin. Several scenarios can trigger this confrontation:

1. If the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house after speaking with several NPCs in town.
2. If the characters choose to investigate Tresendar Manor.
3. If the party shows no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of ruffians seeks them out and provokes a fight in the street, often as they are leaving a location in town.

### **Confrontation**

If the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, you can describe the scene as follows:

"The Sleeping Giant is a dilapidated tavern at the eastern end of town. Four surly human ruffians loiter on the covered porch, sitting on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They are all adorned in grimy crimson cloaks, and their scowling gazes are fixed on you as you approach.

One of the thugs spits on the ground. "Well, well," he sneers. "Here's a whole bunch of little pups. What's your business here, pups? Did you come to yap at us?"

If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, describe it as follows:

```
As you step back into the street, you notice four armed ruffians waiting for you. They are all humans dressed in filthy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they observe you.

One of the ruffians spits on the ground. "It's time to clear out, strangers. Hand over your belongings and be on your way."
```

Continue the insults and provocations as long as you see fit. The Redbrands will attack within a round or two if the characters do not initiate combat. Neither side should be surprised, given the tension and the clear signs of an impending confrontation.

The group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one will flee toward Tresendar Manor.

#### **Developments**

Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the characters can provide valuable information (see "What the Redbrands Know" sidebar on page 20). While Townmaster Harbin Wester may not want to retain Redbrand prisoners until he is certain the entire gang has been eradicated, the characters can persuade or intimidate him into detaining any captured Redbrands for at least a few days.

If the characters kill the ruffians, most of the townspeople will be appreciative. An exception is the town master, who is concerned about the possibility of Redbrand retaliation. Harbin will not punish the characters but will caution them against causing further trouble.

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

Each character is awarded a skill point upon their successful defeat of the ruffians.

> **Guiding the Players**
>
> Following the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter, the players should sense the necessity of addressing the remaining gang. If it appears the characters are uncertain about their next course of action, one of the NPCs they've previously encountered in town should take the initiative. This NPC can explicitly suggest investigating the Redbrand hideout and direct them toward Tresendar Manor.
>
> However, if the players express a preference for pursuing alternative leads in the region, it's acceptable to proceed to part 3 of the adventure and allow the ruffians to remain a pending matter. Upon the characters' return to Phandalin, ensure it's evident that the Redbrands are creating escalating issues, underscoring the urgency of dealing with them.

## Lavendar Lancer Hideout

The Redbrands' headquarters in Phandalin occupies an underground complex beneath the now-dilapidated Tresendar Manor. Originally, the manor's cellars were designed for the safe storage of provisions, including food and water, in case the estate came under attack. Adjacent to the cellars was a crypt intended for interring deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands, however, have substantially expanded the cellars to serve their own needs, modifying them to accommodate slave pens, workshops, and barracks. Should the characters initiate their search from Tresendar Manor, their entry point into the dungeon is in area 1. Alternatively, if they opt to follow Carp Alderleaf through the secret tunnel he discovered, they gain access to the dungeon via area 8.

### **General Features**

The hideout boasts well-constructed dungeon chambers featuring flagstone floors and walls made of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is situated at a lower level than the eastern end, and staircases guide the characters as they explore.

**Ceilings.** The height of passages and chambers is typically 10 feet, unless otherwise specified.

**Doors.** All doors within the complex are crafted from wood and equipped with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. By default, the doors are unlocked, unless the text states otherwise. Both Iarno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) carry an iron key that can be used to lock or unlock every door within the complex. Lock-picking is possible with thieves' tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check, and doors can be forcefully broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

**Secret Doors.** The map for the Redbrand Hideout is marked with an "S" to indicate the placement of secret doors. These doors are constructed from stone and blend seamlessly with the surrounding walls. Detecting a secret door from a distance of up to 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher. A character who actively searches the wall can uncover the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. These secret doors swing open on concealed iron hinges and are not locked.

**Light.** Most areas within the hideout are illuminated by oil lamps affixed to wall sconces, which are refilled every few hours as necessary.

> **What the Redbrands Know**
>
> If the characters charm or successfully interrogate any of the Redbrands, they can acquire valuable information, including the hideout's location under Tresendar Manor and the following insights:
>
> 1. The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard named Glasstaff, whose nickname originates from his staff, made entirely of glass.
> 2. The Black Spider, a mysterious figure, has hired the Redbrands to deter adventurers and intimidate the local population. The reasons behind these actions remain unknown. Bugbears have been dispatched by the Black Spider to reinforce the Redbrands and provide additional strength.
> 3. The lower section of the complex is guarded by a grotesque "eye monster."
> 4. The Redbrands hold several captives in a location "near the old crypts," which are safeguarded by skeletons.

### **1. Cellar**

Upon exploring the manor grounds, the characters discover the abandoned building. Tracks lead to a stone staircase near a dilapidated kitchen, and at the bottom of these stairs is an unlocked door leading to the cellar. Upon opening the door, provide the following description:

"The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels."

This room is a spacious storage cellar, well-suited to the underhanded activities of the Redbrands. Although barrels contain fresh provisions, there is nothing in this room that suggests the Redbrands' presence.

The barrels house supplies like salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Vigilantly searching the barrels is a noisy endeavor that could alert the Redbrands in area 2.

 **Cistern** : The rectangular cistern holds cold, fresh water, is 10 feet deep, and features a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor. Drain pipes from the manor's roof provide the cistern with water. A waterproof satchel, hidden from plain sight underwater, is attached to a submerged rope along the south cistern wall. It can be discovered with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains valuable items detailed in the "Treasure" section.

 **Secret Door** : A secret door can be found in the southwest corner of the room, as indicated on the Redbrand Hideout map.

**Developments**

This area does not feature any monsters or villains. However, the ruffians in area 2 will become aware of any excessive noise here. They may sneak into the room, gaining the element of surprise if the characters are unaware of their presence.

If a confrontation occurs in this area, and two of the ruffians are defeated, the last ruffian may reveal the secret door as they flee in that direction.

**Treasure**

The waterproof satchel concealed in the cistern contains a potion of healing, a potion of invisibility, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. This is a getaway kit that Iarno keeps in the cellar for emergencies.

### 2. Barracks

The Redbrands in Phandalin have their lodgings scattered throughout the town. These quarters serve as a hideaway, ideal for taking refuge after intimidating the local miners and fur traders.

```
This chamber appears to have been converted from a storage room into makeshift living quarters. Two double bunks are neatly arranged against the wall near the entrance, while barrels and crates occupy the room's southern half.
```

Within the room, three Redbrand ruffians are taking a break. If they detect significant commotion from area 1, such as loud voices or the sound of barrels being moved, they prepare themselves for a potential confrontation and attempt to catch intruders off guard.

The barrels in this area contain similar supplies to those found in area 1.

#### Treasure

All three Redbrands possess belt pouches containing various treasures. The first holds 16 silver pieces and 7 gold pieces; the second, 12 silver pieces and 5 gold pieces; and the third, 15 electrum pieces and two garnets, each valued at 10 gold pieces. Furthermore, three worn, scarlet cloaks hang from the bunks.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Distribute 300 XP equally among the characters if the party overcomes the ruffians.

### 3. Trapped Hall

This corridor was originally a segment of Tresendar Manor's ancient cellars. The Redbrands, however, excavated beneath the stone floor, fashioning a concealed pit trap.

```
A thick layer of dust obscures the flagstone tiles in this gloomy hallway. Every ten feet, faux columns decorate the walls, while the double doors at the western end display copper plating that has now turned green with age. These doors feature an intricately carved depiction of a sorrowful angel.
```

Concealed in the middle of the corridor is a perilous pit trap, concealed beneath a facade of loose stone tiles supported by breakaway timbers. When subjected to a weight of 100 pounds or more, the tiles and timbers collapse. Characters scrutinizing the hallway for traps can discern the hidden pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check also reveals narrow ledges running along the northern and southern edges of the pit. A character attempting to maneuver around the pit by using one of these ledges must successfully complete a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

A character who triggers the trap or fails the Dexterity check while attempting to bypass the pit must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to clutch the edge. On a failed save, the character tumbles 20 feet into the pit, enduring 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS

Distribute 100 XP equally among the characters if the party successfully avoids or survives the pit trap.

### 4. Tresendar Crypts

The mausoleum was the final resting place of the long-forgotten Tresendar family elders.

```
Within the dimly lit crypt, three substantial stone sarcophagi occupy the space, their surfaces veiled in layers of dust. Resting against each sarcophagus are human skeletons garbed in fragments of corroded mail. The chamber's walls feature faux columns carved to resemble expansive oak trees, and the double doors in the southeastern corner are covered with aged copper plates.
```

When any creature approaches within 10 feet of the door leading to area 5 or the door leading to area 6, the three skeletons animate, instinctively attacking unless the intruder wears the distinct scarlet cloak of the Redbrands or utters the password "Illefam," which references an ancient elven realm that once spanned a significant part of the Sword Coast.

The stone lids of each sarcophagus bear carvings of the individuals interred withinâ€”two noble male humans and one noble female human. Should the tombs be opened, they reveal mostly decayed bones and remnants of clothing, detailed in the "Treasure" section.

#### Developments

Combat in this chamber will serve as a warning to the Redbrands in area 5, alerting them to the impending threat.

#### Treasure

Within the remnants of each sarcophagus, a platinum signet ring (50 gp) can be found among the bones.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Distribute 150 XP equally among the characters if the party successfully vanquishes the skeletons.

### 5. Slave Pens

For the last two months, the Redbrands have been seizing travelers in the vicinity, imprisoning them within these cells for eventual sale into slavery.

```
This elongated chamber is sectioned into three parts, featuring iron bars that partition the north and south areas. Filthy straw litters the floors of these cells, while their hinged doors are secured by chains and padlocks. In the southern cell, two disheveled human women are confined, while a young human boy is isolated in the northern one. All three individuals are clad in simple gray tunics, and iron collars are affixed around their necks.
```

A pile of discarded clothing is carelessly strewn against the far wall.

Two Redbrand ruffians donned in scarlet cloaks serve as guards in this place. However, they mostly occupy their time by mocking the hapless prisoners, as detailed in the "Captives" section. If they hear commotion originating from area 5, they position themselves against the wall near the door and attempt to catch intruders by surprise. The captives, plagued by fear, remain too cowed to issue warnings or seek assistance.

The heap of garments belongs to the numerous captives held in this cell over the past couple of months, likely numbering more than a dozen people based on the size of the collection.

Cell Doors: The cell doors are equipped with basic locks that can be picked using thieves' tools with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Alternatively, they can be forcefully torn open through sheer strength with a successful DC 22 Strength check.

#### Captives

The three commoner prisoners here are Mirna Dendrar and her two adolescent children: thirteen-year-old Nars and eighteen-year-old Nilsa. A few days ago, the Redbrands brutally murdered Mirna's husband, Thel, for resisting their demands. (His body can be found in area 8.) That same night, the gang stormed their home in Phandalin, abducting the family. The gang intends to sell the family into the bonds of slavery.

The Dendrars hold deep gratitude toward the rescuing characters, although they have limited information concerning the Redbrand hideout. Their knowledge only extends to the fact that the leader is a wizard, whose name they're unaware of since they haven't encountered him. The Dendrars mention "tall, furry creatures with large ears" (bugbears) in the employ of the Redbrands.

**Side Quest: Mirna's Heirloom.** Although the Dendrars have nothing to offer as a reward, Mirna suggests that she might possess information about a valuable family heirloom. In her youth, her family fled from the town of Thundertree following an undead onslaught that overran the place. Her family operated an herb and alchemy shop where a case containing an emerald necklace was concealed beneath a section of storage shelves. She never dared to return and retrieve it. The shop was situated in the southeastern part of Thundertree. If the characters opt to explore the Thundertree ruins, consult part 3 of the adventure.

#### Awarding Experience Points

Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party overcomes the ruffians. Divide 100 XP equally among the characters if the Dendrars return safely to town.


### 6. Armory

The entrance to this room is secured with a lock, and it can only be opened from the exterior. Situated opposite the locked door is a concealed entrance leading to area 7. For more details regarding locked doors and secret doors, refer to the "General Features" section on page 20.

```
The walls of this chamber are adorned with racks filled with an array of weaponry, encompassing spears, swords, crossbows, and bolts. A total of twelve grimy red cloaks are suspended on hooks near the door.
```

The Redbrands have grand aspirations for bolstering their ranks in the near future, which has prompted them to amass an arsenal of arms and armor.

The weapon racks contain twelve spears, six shortswords, four longswords, six light crossbows, and eight quivers, each stocked with twenty crossbow bolts.

### 7. Storeroom and Work Area

In this space, the Redbrands meticulously catalog their pilfered possessions, making preparations for their transportation through the southern cave passage or arranging them for safekeeping within the stronghold.

```
This portion forms the northern extremity of a capacious, naturally formed cavern. The walls are artfully constructed using dressed stone blocks, and the floor is fashioned from durable flagstones. You'll notice a collection of barrels neatly positioned against the cavern's walls. Adjacent to these are numerous vacant crates, bundles of straw used for packing, as well as tools like hammers, pry bars, and nails.

As you peer southwards, the cavern stretches ahead for quite some distance, revealing multiple passageways branching off from the larger chamber. You also spot what appears to be a substantial pit or crevasse embedded within the floor.
```

Within this chamber, concealed from plain sight, lie two secret doors: one grants access to area 6, while the other leads to area 12. For more details regarding secret doors, please consult the "General Features" section on page 20.

#### Treasure

In terms of valuable contents, the majority of the items here are of modest worth. However, among them, you discover thirty beaver pelts, each worth 2 gold pieces. These pelts were recently plundered from a convoy traveling along the Triboar Trail just a few days ago.

### 8. Crevasse

The characters find themselves in this area through one of three different routes: the tunnel connecting to area 1, the storeroom in area 7, or the rough-hewn passage to the south. This southern passage extends beyond the map for about a hundred feet, eventually leading to an exit in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. It provides an ideal clandestine means of smuggling individuals or goods in and out of Phandalin, keeping them concealed from prying eyes, making it a suitable choice for a group of slavers and thieves.

```
Within this vast and chilling cavern, a peculiar, cold draft drifts through, carrying with it a faint, ominous aroma of decaying flesh. A rift cleaves the cavern in two, flanked by two roughly hewn stone columns that serve as support for the twenty-foot-tall ceiling. Two wooden bridges, each fashioned with arches, traverse the chasm.
```

This cavern's guardian is a nothicâ€”an unhinged subterranean monstrosity with an insatiable appetite for flesh. The creature was originally drawn here by a faint magical aura emanating from the crevasse. When the Redbrands took over, their leader, Iarno, struck an agreement with the nothic. In exchange for treasure and a regular supply of fresh meat, the nothic was persuaded to assist in guarding the stronghold. However, its loyalty remains unpredictable.

The nothic lurks close to the western ends of the two bridges. Upon noticing intruders entering the cave, it conceals itself behind one of the large stone columns and surveils them. The creature tries to use its unique ability, Weird Insight, to extract secrets from the characters.

The nothic communicates telepathically, favoring negotiation over aggression, and is willing to betray the Redbrands if the right incentive is offered, such as food. When role-playing the nothic, adopt a whispering tone with sporadic fits of mad cackles and incoherent mutterings. It doesn't actually speak but rather implants its unsettling thoughts and demands in the characters' minds. The nothic possesses all the knowledge the Redbrands have; refer to the "What the Redbrands Know" sidebar on page 20.

As for the bridges, they consist of wooden planks without any railing. The southern one is intentionally designed to collapse when a creature weighing over 50 pounds moves across it. Any character next to the bridge can recognize its subpar construction with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Additionally, any creature can use an action to dislodge one end of either bridge, causing it to plunge into the crevasse.

The crevasse itself is steep-sided, measuring 5 to 10 feet in width and 20 feet in depth. Its rugged walls can be easily climbed without requiring an ability check. A character unfortunate enough to fall into the crevasse sustains 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone amid a mass of rubble, which becomes difficult terrain.

Notably, the bottom of the crevasse has an eerie chill. When viewed with a detect magic spell, the area emits a faint necromantic aura. This magical presence causes organic matter within the crevasse to age and decompose at half the usual rate. At the bottom, among the broken and gnawed bones, lies the partially devoured corpse of Thel Dendrar, the Phandalin woodcarver who met his end at the hands of the Redbrands, and whose body they left for the nothic to consume.

#### Treasure

As for the treasure, the nothic safeguards its riches in a battered wooden chest secreted in a niche beneath the north bridge, at the crevasse's bottom. The chest remains out of sight when observed from the crevasse's edge, but any character descending into the chasm can readily spot it. The chest contains 160 silver pieces, 120 gold pieces, five malachite gems, each worth 15 gold pieces, two potions of healing, and a scroll of augury.

Additionally, the chest houses a +1 longsword enclosed within a silver-chased scabbard. The sword bears the inscription "Talon," and its hilt takes on the form of a bird of prey with its wings outstretched. It once belonged to a renowned knight named Aldith Tresendar, who was known as the Black Hawk. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can identify the sword's significance and recollect this historical lore. Sir Aldith lost his life defending against an orc assault through the concealed caverns below his manor, and his prized blade, Talon, was left behind until it was found by the nothic.

### Awarding Experinece Points

In terms of experience points, divide 450 XP equally among the characters if the party manages to either defeat the nothic or negotiate a truce with it.

### 9. Guard Barracks

A character who listens at this door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can discern several gruff voices speaking derogatory commands in the Goblin tongue, such as "Lick the floor!" and "Roll like a dog!" The bugbears in this room are tormenting their goblin captive.

```
This chamber serves as a barracks, furnished with four rudimentary wooden bunks, topped with rumpled blankets, and littered with soiled dishes. An unpleasant odor of unwashed bodies and decaying food permeates the air. Among the chaos, three tall, furry humanoids lounge, sadistically issuing orders to a pitiful goblin who debases itself for their entertainment. The sudden appearance of your party startles the goblin to the point of fainting.
```

Present in the room are three bugbears and one goblin, known as Droop. The sight of your party causes Droop to lose consciousness, although another character can use an action to rouse him. Otherwise, Droop remains incapacitated for 1d10 minutes.

These bugbears work under the command of the Black Spider and were dispatched here to assist Iarno in maintaining control over both the Redbrands and Phandalin's citizens. The bugbear leader, Mosk, peculiarly sports a jeweled eye patch, despite having both his eyes intact. He wears it purely because he finds it to be a fancy and distinctive accessory.

The bugbears steer clear of the human members of the Redbrands. If your characters are adorned in scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears will assume they serve Iarno. Resourceful characters may even manage to persuade the bugbears to assist in dealing with supposed "traitors" or "impostors" elsewhere in the dungeon. If you feel the players' deception role-play could be improved, have the primary spokesperson make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the bugbears to comply with the party's wishes.

#### Roleplaying Droop

Droop, the goblin, poses no threat to the party, as he has been cowed by the bugbears and follows their orders until someone stronger takes command. If he regains consciousness during combat, Droop hides and avoids the fray. He is such a coward that if compelled to fight, he does so with disadvantage.

Droop possesses knowledge of the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, including the locations of secret doors and traps. However, he doesn't spontaneously offer this information but will reveal it if prompted, though his details might be somewhat confusing or muddled. After the bugbears are dispatched, Droop seeks to endear himself to the party and help in any way possible.

#### Developments

Regarding developments, the bugbears are the only individuals in the Redbrand hideout who are privy to the location of Wave Echo Cave. They won't voluntarily divulge this information due to their greater fear of the Black Spider than of your characters. Additionally, the bugbears know the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle but won't readily share this knowledge either. To extract this information from a captured bugbear, a character must succeed in a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check.

#### Treasure

In terms of treasure, Mosk carries a belt pouch containing 33 silver pieces and wears an eye patch fashioned from black leather and adorned with semiprecious stones (worth 50 gold pieces). He also possesses an iron key capable of locking and unlocking all doors in the Redbrand hideout.

#### Awarding Experience Points

For experience points, divide 600 XP equally among the characters if the party manages to defeat the bugbears.

### 10. Common Room

This area functions as the Redbrands' central command and gathering space. When official business isn't in session, it transforms into a common area where the fortress's guards can unwind during their off hours.

If a character listens at the door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, they can overhear the villains inside immersed in a knucklebones game. This results in a mysterious clinking noise, followed by exclamations, moans, and a sudden chatter of voices as bets are settled. If the party abruptly enters the room, they automatically take the occupants by surprise.

```
The room features numerous worn tables and chairs, with wooden benches lining the walls adorned with drapes of brown and red. Several kegs of ale are propped up and tapped.

Four burly human warriors, donned in scarlet cloaks, have gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is piled on the tabletop among them.
```

They're engaged in drinking and playing knucklebones, and the game is on the verge of turning heated, as most games do. The dice are rigged, with the ruffian who owns them naturally winning. All four have been consuming copious amounts of alcohol, leaving them poisoned (refer to the rulebook's appendix for the effects of being poisoned).

Upon the party's entrance, the Redbrands instantly identify any characters wearing scarlet cloaks as impostors. Nonetheless, articulate characters might still attempt to pass themselves off as "new recruits," particularly if they express interest in joining the game. If you feel the players' deception role-play could be enhanced, have the primary spokesperson make a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check to hoodwink the Redbrands.

#### Treasure

As for treasure, all the wealth on the table has been wagered in the game. (Knocking over the table or mixing up their loot is an effective way to momentarily distract them.) The total value includes 75 copper pieces, 55 silver pieces, 22 electrum pieces, 15 gold pieces, and a gold earring adorned with a small ruby (worth 30 gold pieces).

#### Awarding Experinece Points

For experience points, divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party manages to vanquish the Redbrands in this room.

### 11. Runesmith's Workshop

Through either door of this room, faint bubbling and dripping sounds can be discerned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

```
This chamber takes the form of a wizard's workshop, with a rat darting across the floor and finding refuge under a large worktable, adorned with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all actively bubbling and simmering away. The bookshelves in the room are brimming with piles of parchment and peculiar-looking tomes.
```

Iarno has entrusted his rat familiar with the duty of keeping an eye out for intruders. The rat shares a telepathic link with its master, sending a quick alert message to Iarno as soon as it detects intruders. The rat moves at a pace of 20 feet and boasts an AC of 10, possesses 1 hit point, and lacks effective attack abilities. If the rat is eliminated, it vanishes.

If the characters opt to leave the rat unharmed, it will follow them around as if driven by curiosity or hunger. It might even pretend to be affectionate towards a character who feeds it, but its loyalty remains firmly with Iarno.

**Books and Notes.** Within the room, you'll find books and notes scattered about, as Iarno is striving to master the art of brewing potions and creating alchemical mixtures. These books and notes primarily consist of basic texts on alchemy. Any character with proficiency in Arcana can observe that Iarno's setup seems to be geared toward crafting potions of invisibility, although he has yet to achieve success.

Among the books, there's a tome penned in Dwarvish. It's the journal of an adventurer named Urmon, detailing the history of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells (Information in the first and second paragraphs of the "Background" section). In addition, Urmon's journal recounts that a magical mace named Lightbringer was commissioned by Lathander, the god of dawn, from the mages collaborating with gnomes and dwarves from Phandelver's Pact. This mace went missing when Wave Echo Cave and its mine vanished from history. (Characters might find the mace in part 4, "Wave Echo Cave.")

#### Developments

In terms of developments, since Iarno and his rat familiar maintain a telepathic bond, the mage (in area 12) becomes aware that the characters are approaching and thus has time to make preparations.

#### Treasure

Regarding treasure, most of the materials in this room lack value, but three small bottles contain rare reagents: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. These reagents are worth 25 gold pieces each to an apothecary or alchemist.

### 12. Glasstaff's Quarters

If the characters approach this room via the secret passage from area 7, they can catch the leader of the Redbrands, Iarno "Glasstaff" Albrek, off guard. Otherwise, if they approach through area 11, his rat familiar alerts him to their presence, and he hastily flees before they arrive.

```
This room features walls adorned with scarlet cloth drapes, and its furnishings include a small writing desk with a matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest located at the bed's foot.
```

If Iarno is taken by surprise, include the following paragraph:

```
Sitting at the desk is a short, dark-bearded human male dressed in robes, engrossed in the study of a tome. He sports an ermine-trimmed princely mantle and keeps a splendid glass staff leaning against his chair, within easy reach.
```

However, if the rat in area 11 alerts him to the approaching danger, Iarno, the malevolent mage, swiftly retrieves his staff of defense (see the appendix) and the scrolls from his chest (see the "Treasure" section) before making his escape through the secret door in the northeast corner of the room. In his rush, Iarno inadvertently leaves a letter from the Black Spider behind (see the "Developments" section), and fails to secure the secret door completely. Characters gain an advantage on ability checks when trying to locate the slightly ajar secret door (see "Advantage and Disadvantage" in the rulebook). For additional information on secret doors, refer to the "General Features" section (page 20).

If he successfully escapes, Iarno flees to area 1 (through areas 7 and 8) and retrieves the satchel hidden in the cistern there. If the nothic in area 8 is still alive, Iarno instructs it to waylay any pursuers. If the characters manage to catch up to him, Iarno drinks the potion of invisibility from the satchel and makes a hasty exit from the hideout. Depending on your discretion, he may reappear later in the adventure.

#### Roleplaying Iarno

In terms of roleplaying, a former member of the Lords' Alliance, Iarno seized the opportunity in Phandalin to enrich himself. Originally assigned to establish a constabulary, he decided to gather a band of outlaws and local ruffians instead to secure his own position in town. Iarno was already familiar with the Black Spider through his contacts in the Lords' Alliance and brokered a meeting. The drow offered to share the secrets and riches of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his assistance and loyalty.

Iarno tries to maintain an air of gentility and courtesy, addressing his ruffians as "my good gentlemen," and referring to deplorable acts such as kidnapping or arson as "that unpleasant little business" or "those unfortunate events." He calls the characters "guests" and expresses regret that he can't offer proper entertainment for their visit. However, beneath this faÃ§ade, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.

If he feels threatened, Iarno uses his staff of defense to cast mage armor on himself and proceeds to cast offensive spells at enemies he can see. His stat block includes a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, refer to the rulebook. Iarno employs the shield power of his staff for extra protection.

Should he be reduced to 8 or fewer hit points with no means of escape, Iarno surrenders, valuing his life above all else, hoping that his model behavior as a prisoner might lead the Black Spider to secure his release.

If questioned while in captivity, Iarno provides the following information, all of which is accurate:

* The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).
* The Black Spider sent three bugbears to assist Iarno in controlling the population of Phandalin, but the Redbrands have managed without them. The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but Iarno does not.
* The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact used the magical forge to create powerful magic items.
* No other members of the Lords' Alliance are aware of Iarno's betrayal.

### Develoments

In terms of developments, various papers and notes are neatly stacked on the desk, primarily consisting of Iarno's written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for additional materials for his workshop. Among these documents, the characters also discover a letter marked with the Black Spider's symbol.

```
Lord Albrek,

Reports from my sources in Neverwinter indicate that unknown individuals are en route to Phandalin. These individuals may be in the employ of the dwarves. If possible, apprehend them. If necessary, eliminate them, but do not permit them to disrupt our operations. Ensure that any dwarven maps within their possession are swiftly delivered to me. I am relying on you, Iarno. Do not let me down.
```

In the event that Iarno is apprehended, Sildar Hallwinter takes measures to have the wizard confined within the townmaster's hall until safe transportation back to Neverwinter can be arranged. The question of whether Iarno faces a trial for his crimes falls outside the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too engrossed in his own concerns to interfere with the wizard's fate.

#### Treasure

Positioned at the foot of Iarno's bed is an unlocked and robust wooden chest. It contains the most valuable items amassed by the Redbrands over the last two months, including 180 silver pieces, 130 gold pieces, and a silk pouch containing five carnelians (valued at 10 gold pieces each), two peridots (each worth 15 gold pieces), and one pearl (with an estimated worth of 100 gold pieces). The chest also contains two magical items brought to Phandalin by Iarno from Neverwinter: a scroll of charm person and a scroll of fireball. Additionally, Iarno wields a staff of defense (refer to appendix A).

For experience points, distribute 200 XP evenly among the characters if the party eliminates Iarno Albrek. Double the XP award if they successfully capture Iarno and deliver him to Sildar Hallwinter in Phandalin.

#### Awarding Experinece

In terms of what's next, the adventure proceeds to the next phase, part 3, titled "The Spider's Web." During this segment, the characters engage in several short adventures that propel the storyline forward. It is likely that at some point in part 2, the characters will reach 3rd level, so it's important for players to keep track of their XP.
