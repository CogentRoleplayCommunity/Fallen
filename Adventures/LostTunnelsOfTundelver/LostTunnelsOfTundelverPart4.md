## **Part 4: Wave Echo Cave**

Situated fifteen miles to the east of Phandalin, in the deep valleys of the Sword Mountains, Wave Echo Cave hides the rich mine of Phandelver's Pact, which was lost five centuries ago during orc invasions that ravaged this part of the North. Over the centuries, numerous prospectors and adventurers have sought the mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found its entrance just a month ago. However, they were unaware they were trailed by spies in the service of Nezznar, the Black Spider, who followed them to their discovery. The drow villain dealt with the two Rockseeker guardians, arranged for Gundren's ambush, and upon learning of the adventurers' association with Gundren and their exploits in Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders to eliminate the characters. Meanwhile, Nezznar commences his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.

Nezznar seeks the Forge of Spells, where human mages from old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome contraptions. However, Nezznar's progress has been impeded by restless undead and perilous monsters within Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with extreme caution.

The adventurers now have an opportunity to assist Gundren, avenge his kin, and thwart the Black Spider's sinister plans. Furthermore, the rumored hoard of potent magic hidden within the mines promises a valuable prize.

## **Character Level**

This part of the adventure is designed for characters who are at least 4th level and have earned a minimum of 2,700 XP. If the adventurers have skipped many of the optional investigations and encounters in part 3, they may not yet be 4th level, and several encounters in this section could prove challenging.

## **Experience Point Awards**

In this section of the adventure, XP is granted for overcoming monsters, as in parts 2 and 3. However, XP rewards for monsters are not explicitly provided in the encounter descriptions. Instead, each monster's XP value is indicated in its stat block (refer to appendix B). Players calculate the award by summing the values of the monsters they conquer. Additional XP awards and the rationale for them are described in the text under the "Awarding Experience Points" heading.

## **Wandering Monsters**

Monsters are known to roam throughout the entire mine. Random encounters serve as a reminder that monsters aren't restricted to specific areas and that no part of the dungeon is completely safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are a useful means of keeping players and characters alert, alleviating potential player boredom, and testing party resources. Nonetheless, overusing random encounters can become tedious, so they should be employed judiciously.

Should the characters spend an extended period in a particular area, the Dungeon Master can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. An encounter occurs on a roll of 17-20. Conversely, if the players seem restless, the Dungeon Master can decide that an encounter takes place. By rolling a d12 and referring to the Wandering Monsters table, the nature of the encounter can be determined.

**Wandering Monsters Table**

1-3 Sti rges (2d4)

4-5 Ghouls (1d4)

6 Gricks (1d4)

7-8 Bugbears (1d4)

9 Skeletons (1d6)

10 Zombies (1d6)

11-12 Ochre Jelly (1)

## **General Features**

The mine is characterized by its cold, damp atmosphere and surprising drafts. A noticeable breeze moves through many of the passages, flowing from area 1 to area 16.

***Ceilings.*** Tunnels generally feature 10-foot-high ceilings unless otherwise noted. Rooms possess 20-foot-high ceilings, while natural caverns are endowed with 30-foot-high ceilings adorned with stalactites.

***Doors.*** With the exception of specific notes, doors are 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and constructed from six-inch-thick stone slabs with iron handles and hinges. These doors are low and wide, ideal for dwarves.

***Walls.*** The walls are constructed from hewn stone. In certain areas (14, 15, 19, and 20), they are adorned with well-fitted stone blocks.

***Floors.*** All floors are fashioned from smooth, natural stone.

***Light.*** Unless otherwise indicated, there is no light. The boxed text assumes that characters possess light sources or darkvision.

***Stalagmites.*** These rocky spires, found in many natural caverns, rise from the ground and can serve as cover (see the "Cover" rules in the rulebook).

## Keyed Encounters

All the encounters in this part of the adventure correspond to the map of Wave Echo Cave.

```
BOOMING WAVES

Every exceptional dungeon has distinguishing features that make it unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. Throughout the mine, there is a rhythmic sound of thunderous waves that reverberates, causing the very ground beneath to shudder. These waves come roughly every two minutes, intensifying as one moves northeast.

While Wave Echo Cave is far from the ocean, a water-filled cavern deep within the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. This spring continuously overflows, creating a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, producing a noise resembling crashing waves. On occasion, you should describe this sound to the players. It will pique their curiosity and draw them towards its source, naturally enticing them to venture deeper into the mine.
```

**1. CAVE ENTRANCE**

Whether the characters are following Gundren's map or have received directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel concealed within the Sword Mountain foothills.

```
The entrance tunnel opens into a large cavern supported by a natural rock pillar and containing three stalagmites. Behind the rock column in the western part of the cave are three bedrolls and an assortment of everyday supplies such as sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other equipment. Amidst these supplies lies the body of a deceased dwarf miner, who has been lifeless for at least a week.

The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, creating a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tethered around a nearby stalagmite, hanging down the side of the pit. At the pit's base, a rough-hewn tunnel stretches northwest and east.
```

This area used to serve as the campsite for the Rockseeker brothers. The deceased dwarf is Tharden, Gundren's brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren's other brother, Nundro, was also here and is now a prisoner of the Black Spider in area 20. While the dwarves' supplies may be potentially useful, they aren't particularly valuable.

***Open Pit.*** Climbing up or down the pit's wall without a rope necessitates a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails this check by a margin of 5 or more will fall, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen and ending up prone at the pit's bottom. The tunnel at the pit's base leads northwest towards area 2 and east towards area 3.

#### **Treasure**

Tharden wears a pair of boots of striding and springing. In his hurry to explore the rest of Wave Echo Cave, Nezznar missed them.

### **2. Mine Tunnels**

This intricate network of passages constitutes an old section of the original Wave Echo Cave mine.

```
This area is characterized by multiple intersecting passageways with ceilings that are only six feet high, and some of these passages lead to partially excavated rock faces.
```

These dead-end passages mark areas where the miners abandoned their efforts, opting to move on to other locations. In one of these passages, an ochre jelly patiently lurks, waiting for an opportunity to attack a solitary target as the party enters this section of the mine.

### **3. Old Entrance**

The southern tunnel once served as the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave but was buried during the destruction that shook the mines centuries ago. This was the site of a fierce battle when orcs laid siege to the mines. The fallen still lie where they perished.

```
In this naturally formed, thirty-foot-high cavern, the walls are adorned with simple reliefs depicting hardworking dwarf and gnome miners. Below these carvings, the cavern floor is strewn with the remains of almost two dozen skeletons, some of dwarves and others orcs, all in rusted, scant armor. Several large brass lanterns are situated in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none of them are lit.
```

Clutching the ceiling like bats are ten stirges. These creatures find little living prey in the mines and are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely to catch them by surprise. Characters not watching the ceiling will be surprised, unless their passive Wisdom (Perception) score exceeds the total of the stirges' Dexterity (Stealth) check (roll once for all of them). Characters who avoid surprise will hear a flapping noise as the stirges descend to attack.

The lanterns and carvings of miners at work were originally meant to welcome newcomers.

**4. Old Guardroom**

This chamber once functioned as a guardroom protecting the nearby mine entrance, but it was overrun early in the fighting when the ores launched their attack.

```
The room is now filled with shattered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling. Among the rubble are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.
```

The round after any living creature enters this chamber, the bones begin to stir and reassemble, forming nine skeletons. They will fight until destroyed.

### **5. ASSAYERS' OFFICE**

This room, formerly the domain of the mine's assayers, was once a hub for weighing ore samples and compensating the diligent miners for their toil.

Within this chamber, the remnants of its past purpose are evident. A substantial stone counter divides the room, adorned with three dusty iron balance scales. On the north wall, cubbyholes have been carved out, filled with aged, dusty paper scraps. Several lifeless bodies, gnomes and ores from the looks of them, lie sprawled across the floor.

The paper within the cubbyholes, ancient and brittle, disintegrates upon contact. However, a character well-versed in Dwarvish can discern faint markings on a few surviving scraps, which record weigh-ins and disbursements.

#### **Treasure**

Behind the counter, a securely locked iron strongbox can be found, requiring the skills of a proficient thief with the proper tools. To unlock it, one must succeed in a DC 20 Dexterity check. This pay chest, overlooked during the turmoil of past battles, houses 600 copper pieces, 180 silver pieces, 90 electrum pieces, and 60 gold pieces.

### **6. South Barracks**

This room served as a miners' barracks, providing rest for the skilled delvers working within Wave Echo Cave between their shifts. Anyone who listens at the partially open door can faintly discern crunching and splintering sounds, making a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to do so.

```
Inside this chamber, old stone bunks are neatly arranged along the walls, while a corroded iron brazier filled with cold coals sits near the room's center. The floor is strewn with the bones of half a dozen dwarves and orcs, all adorned with fragments of their armor. Amongst the remains, three gray, hunched figures squat, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones.
```

Three ghouls from the pack in area 9 are present, cracking and gnawing at the ancient bones in the hopes of finding some remaining morsels of marrow. Eager for a fresh meal, the ghouls attack immediately.

### **7. Ruined Storeroom**

Despite the widespread destruction, the northern part of this storage area remains relatively intact.

```
The eastern wall of this chamber has collapsed into a mass of rubble. To the north, a door stands slightly ajar, leading to a moderately-sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are neatly stacked against the walls, all of which are cracked and split open from age.
```

While it may not be the most comfortable resting place, the storeroom is secure and safe from monsters. No threats will come through this area, and the storeroom door, despite its age, can be easily barricaded from the inside.

The contents of the kegs have long since evaporated.

### **8. FUNGI CAVERN**

This cave has been a thorn in the side of Nezznar's explorations. The drow has reason to believe that the mine's magical workshops are in close proximity, but he's wary of engaging with the resident monsters in this area.

The cavern floor is blanketed by an expanse of peculiar fungi, covering extensive sections of the terrain. This fungal growth encompasses various forms, including foot-wide puffballs, bizarre shelf fungi adorning stalagmites, and towering stalks and caps, reaching up to five feet in height. Notably, some of these puffballs emit an eerie green phosphorescent glow.

For the most part, the fungi is innocuous. Interestingly, the green-glowing fungi provide adequate illumination throughout the entire cavern, making the use of darkvision or light sources unnecessary.

**Poison Gas:** However, when any entity attempts to traverse this cavern, the fungal carpets carpeting the floor unleash toxic gases into the air. Each creature present in the cavern must succeed in a DC 11 Constitution saving throw to avoid suffering 3d6 poison damage and being afflicted with the poisoned condition for a duration of 10 minutes (for more details on the poisoned condition, please refer to the rulebook). The poison gas dissipates within a minute. Until that occurs, any living creature concluding its turn within the cavern must reattempt the saving throw.

### **9. Great Cavern**

This expansive chamber once functioned as the miners' communal area, serving as both a banquet hall and meeting place where they'd unwind after a hard day's labor.

```
The cavern is divided into three distinct sections: elevated ledges at either end, and a central lower area. Stone stairs are carved into the sides, leading up to the ledges. In the middle section, you'll find two substantial tables accompanied by old braziers. There's a smaller table on the eastern ledge. A somber display of skeletal remains sprawled across the floor bears witness to the intense conflicts that transpired here, involving dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres.
```

In the shadows on the western ledge, seven ghouls hide, vigilant for any light or sound elsewhere in the cave. When alerted, they swiftly descend to engage their prey, their ravenous hunger driving them to battle until they are vanquished.

The 10-foot-high escarpments require a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. A fall or forceful push from the top results in 1d6 bludgeoning damage, with the unfortunate individual landing in a prone position.

### **10. Dark Pool**

This water-filled cave conceals valuable treasures.

```
Most of this cavern is occupied by a calm, dark pool. The water is enigmatic, offering little visibility into its depths. The pool's edge is adorned with a thin layer of pale mussel shell fragments, emitting a slight fishy odor.

A passage leads southward from this area, while a set of steps ascends to the east. A languid stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.
```

The pool's central region reaches a depth of 20 feet. The northeast stream measures 3 feet in depth, and the passage's ceiling hovers 2 to 3 feet above the water's surface. Characters can wade through the stream effortlessly, reaching area 18.

Upon examining the pool's depths, an adventurous character stumbles upon the well-preserved skeleton of a human wizard from ancient Phandalin. The wizard met his demise while defending the mines against orc invaders, and his ribcage still clutches several orc arrows.

#### Treasure

The wizard's remains bear two platinum rings (valued at 75 gp each) and clasp a wand of magic missiles in its bony grasp.

### **11. North Barracks**

The eastern door is barricaded from within, necessitating a DC 20 Strength check to force it open. A character who listens at either door and passes a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear gruff voices engaged in a conversation conducted in the Goblin language, expressing their growing hunger.

```
This chamber houses old stone bunks lining the walls, with a warm glow emanating from a central iron brazier.
```

If the party enters from the west, an additional description is needed:

```
On the opposite side of the room, there is another door, obstructed by a makeshift barricade constructed from the remnants of a wooden table.
```

Five bugbears inhabit this room, faithfully serving Nezznar. This room marks the front line in the Black Spider's assault on Wave Echo Cave, and the bugbears are tasked with deterring any ghouls, zombies, or other undead from disturbing their master in his lair (area 19). Like area 6, this chamber was once a miner's barracks. Nezznar's bugbears removed the corpses they found and constructed the barricade.

#### Treasure

The most sizeable bugbear carries a pouch containing 15 cp, 13 ep, and a potion of vitality.

**12. Smelter Cavern**

Similar to area 8, this cavern represents a significant hindrance for Nezznar's progress. The drow senses that the mine's magical forges are close, but he is hesitant to confront the guardians present in this region.

```
The cavern boasts a massive blast furnace accompanied by a mechanical bellows, powered by a dry waterwheel. The furnace currently stands dormant and devoid of light. The room is filled with piles of coal and carts loaded with unprocessed ore. Two passages extend west and south, while another set of stairs climbs to the east. The dry channel leading out of the cave exits to the north and east.

Numerous lifeless corpses of dwarves and orcs, still adorned in tattered armor, are scattered throughout the room. Hovering over them is a skull, enshrouded in an eerie green flame.
```

Among the fallen dwarf warriors, eight of them become reanimated as zombies, emerging to pursue any living intruders within the room. However, they do not venture beyond this area for more than one round. In addition to these, a more intelligent undead entity, a flameskull, stands guard over this location. This entity was originally a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act upon ancient directives aimed at obstructing any unauthorized passage.

This impressive chamber previously served as the hub of Wave Echo Cave's mining operation. Here, dwarves smelted ore to yield silver, gold, and platinum ingots. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from area 18 to power the waterwheel located here, in turn, operating the bellows responsible for feeding the furnace. The channel's bottom lies 5 feet below the floor level, and no specific skill checks are required to enter or exit it. Characters inside the channel can follow it to the north or east, although the ceiling drops to a mere 5 feet in height after leaving this chamber.

### 13. Starry Cavern

The remnants of a fierce magical battle waged centuries ago between orcs and their hired wizards can still be witnessed in this area, evident in the structural damage and the scattered skeletal remains. This cavern, once the target of their conflict, now offers an awe-inspiring spectacle.

```
The cavern's ceiling sparkles with dazzling minerals, reflecting light in such a way that it emulates a starry night sky. Dozens of skeletons, some crushed beneath fallen debris, litter the cavern floor.

This spacious cavern accommodates two standalone structures, unlike the dwarf-sized architecture found elsewhere in the mines. Both of these stone buildings are designed for human-sized inhabitants. The masonry walls of these structures appear battered and scorched, with their double doors cracked and marred. A rugged escarpment divides the cavern, with a flight of stairs chiseled into it. Passageways branch out to the north, south, and west.
```

For a detailed description of the damaged buildings, please refer to sections 14 and 15. While the minerals in the ceiling may be visually captivating, they possess neither magical nor monetary value.

Characters proficient in Arcana may sense a subtle undercurrent of magic in the cavern, which intensifies as they approach the northern building (area 15).

### 14. Wizard's Quarters

The entrance doors to this room exhibit visible signs of wear, with their iron hinges partially melted. Opening them forcefully requires a Strength check with a DC of 15.

```
Within, the room bears the marks of destruction, evident in the ash, dust, fire-blackened walls, and heaps of debris under the sagging ceiling. The furnishings, including tables, chairs, bookshelves, and beds, have been charred or shattered, but they remain surprisingly intact. An iron chest, scorched by the flames, rests near the base of one of the beds.
```

The spirit of Mormesk, the last wizard to perish in this room, still haunts the area. Initially unseen, Mormesk materializes when a living being enters the room. Once a formidable mage, his existence was snuffed out during the climactic battle that devastated the mines. Centuries of resentment have warped his soul into a malevolent apparition.

Mormesk presides over the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. He lingers here because his wealth from life resides within the scorched chest (see the "Treasure" section). Lacking a physical form, he is unable to touch or possess the riches he cherished while alive.

This building formerly served as guest quarters for visiting wizards collaborating in the Forge of Spells (area 15), most of whom were human. The furnishings reflect their human-sized proportions.

#### Roleplay Mormesk

Mormesk speaks in somber, whispering tones. Upon rising from the floor, the wraith utters, "Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!" If the characters make no effort to negotiate, the wraith will attack.

If the characters attempt to reason with the wraith, it will listen, provided they haven't harmed it or taken any of its possessions. The wraith is inherently malevolent, so the only way to stay its spectral hand is to offer something it considers valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk prizes magic items, particularly scrolls, spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Regardless of the offering, a character must succeed in a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.

However, the wraith will never relinquish the wooden pipe from the scorched chest. It will, though, part with the coins and gems in exchange for the characters slaying the spectator in the Forge of Spells (area 15). The wraith doesn't provide details about what a spectator is but simply points in the direction of area 15. Once the wraith receives its desired gift, it allows the characters to peruse its books and retain the secret map found in one of them (refer to the "Treasure" section).

#### Treasure

The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 copper pieces, 160 silver pieces, 50 electrum pieces, three diamonds (each worth 100 gold pieces), and a wooden pipe adorned with platinum filigree (valued at 150 gold pieces).

Several magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves, primarily historical in nature, but one conceals a map sewn into its cover. The presence of the map can be detected with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The map indicates the location of a custom dungeon, offering a lead to the characters' next adventure upon completion of their explorations.

### Runecraft Forge

In this chamber, the collaboration between the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of Phandelver's Pact allowed them to harness the mystical energies found within these caverns. The northernmost door bears the scars of intense heat, its iron hinges partially melted; opening it requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors have suffered similar damage but stand slightly ajar.

```
This expansive workshop has been marred by the remnants of an ancient spell battle that ravaged the mine. Scorched worktables occupy two corners of the room, and the plaster has been seared off the stone walls. In the room's center, a stone pedestal cradles a small brazier, from which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. Strangely, the brazier and its pedestal have remained untouched by the destructive forces that swept through this area.

Hovering behind the brazier with its green flame is a spherical entity, roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks extend from its central mass, two on each side, with a large, unblinking eye at the creature's core.

"Greetings," utters a thick, gurgling voice within your mind.
```

The wraith in Area 14 is determined to drive off or eliminate the spectator, but thus far, the creature has easily fended off the assaults of Mormesk's zombies and ghouls, seemingly oblivious to the undead roaming the mine. Should the party attempt to remove anything from this area, the spectator will attack. If somehow blinded, the creature retreats to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer fulfill the purpose for which it was summoned.

By succeeding in a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check, a character can trick the spectator into believing that one or more party members are wizards or miners employed by the overseers of Wave Echo Cave, dispatched to terminate the spectator's service. If the deception is convincing, the spectator will believe it is free from its obligations, vanishing and returning to its home plane.

**The Brazier of Green Flame.** A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic permeating the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, rendering it unable to permanently enchant magical items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor immersed in the green flame for at least 1 minute temporarily becomes a +1 weapon or +1 armor, respectively, for 1d12 hours (see appendix A). The brazier cannot be removed from the Forge of Enchantment.

**The Northern Chamber.** This small, separate workspace was utilized for the final touches on items being prepared for enchantment, including polishing, lacquering, and other finishing touches. Like the primary workshop, it has sustained severe damage.

#### **Treasure**

On the worktable in the southeast corner of the room, you find the last items that the spectator was tasked to protect: Lightbringer and Dragonguard.

**Lightbringer.** This +1 mace, crafted for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn, boasts a head shaped like a radiant sunburst, made from solid brass. Dubbed Lightbringer, this weapon illuminates as brightly as a torch upon command. While glowing, the mace inflicts an additional 1d6 radiant damage to undead creatures.

**Dragonguard.** This +1 breastplate, adorned with a gold dragon motif in its design, was made for a human hero of Neverwinter named Tergon. It grants its wearer advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of creatures with the dragon type.


### 16. Booming Cavern

The unmistakable sound of pounding surf, which has christened Wave Echo Cave, finds its origins in this water-filled cavern.

```
A narrow ledge affords a view of the expansive chamber, wherein a turbulent and frothing body of water resides. The rhythmic thunders that resonate throughout the mines reach their crescendo here. Periodically, a fresh surge of water rushes into this chamber, crashing against the wall just beneath the ledge. The echoes suggest that this cavern may be one arm of a much grander chamber to the northeast.
```

The ledge, running alongside the southern wall, sits 15 feet above the water's surface. However, every two minutes, when the water surges into the cave, it raises the water level by 10 feet. After a minute, the water level reverts to its standard depth of 20 feet.

### 17. Old Streambed

The stream that previously flowed from Area 10 to Area 18 once continued its journey through this low passageway, eventually spilling into Area 16.

```
This passage barely reaches a height of four feet and is cluttered with rounded boulders and pebbles. In its time, it might have served as a streambed, though no water courses through it today.
```

The dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to Area 12 to power the waterwheel in the smelter. Subsequently, the earthquakes during the final spell battle of the orc invasion rocked Wave Echo Cave, causing the floor in Area 18 to collapse, re-routing the stream once more. The old streambed endures as a viable passage that circumvents the undead lurking in Area 12, although Nezznar remains unaware of this alternate route.

### 18. Collapsed Cavern

This cavern is under occupation by Nezznar's subordinates, serving as both a guard against undead intrusions and a hub for carefully sifting through the debris. The Black Spider's divinations suggest that valuable treasure lies hidden at the rift's bottom, which was created when this area was devastated.

```
A wide rift occupies the eastern half of this cavern. A stream emerges from the western wall, cascades into the rift, and resumes its course northward. Several ropes are anchored to iron stakes along the western edge of the rift, leading down to the chasm floor.
```

Three bugbears are stationed here, two of them diligently clearing rubble on the rift floor, while the third stands sentinel in the western portion of the cavern. A doppelganger, masquerading as a male drow named Vhalak, oversees the operation. In the event of a confrontation in the main cavern, the two bugbears in the rift ascend the ropes to join the skirmish.

**Rift.** The rift plunges to a depth of 20 feet. Climbing up or down without using a rope necessitates a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Should a creature fail the check by a margin of 5 or more, they plummet and sustain 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet fallen, ultimately landing prone at the rift's base.

#### **Developments**

If two or more bugbears meet their end, the doppelganger endeavors to withdraw to Area 19 to warn Nezznar.

#### **Treasure**

Nezznar's divinations prove accurate. Concealed beneath the weighty debris at the rift's bottom lies the crushed skeleton of a dwarf, donning gauntlets of ogre power. The remains remain concealed but can be discovered with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each character searching can attempt one check per hour.

### **19. The Sanctum of Dumathoin**

Nezznar has claimed this chamber as his base of operations while he delves into the depths of the mines in search of the Forge of Spells.

```
This hall is adorned with six weathered marble pillars lining its walls. At the north end, a nine-foot-tall statue of a dwarf, seated regally upon a throne, holds a massive stone warhammer upon its lap. Glistening emeralds catch the light in the statue's eyes.

The floor, once hidden beneath a layer of dust and debris, has been swept clear and now hosts an improvised campsite before the statue. Half a dozen bedrolls and packs are neatly arranged around a rudimentary fire pit. A wooden table stands to the west between two of the marble pillars.
```

Should the chamber's occupants remain unaware of the characters' presence upon their arrival, consider the following addition:

```
Two bugbears flank a dark elf dressed in black leather armor and robes as they stand near the table. The drow clutches a dark staff crowned with a carved spider and regards you with a frown.

"It appears I must handle you personally. Regrettably, it must conclude this way."
```

Nezznar the Black Spider is accompanied by four formidable giant spiders who defend their master to the death. If they anticipate trouble, the spiders conceal themselves behind the pillars while Nezznar cloaks himself in invisibility, positioning near the table. Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the spiders. As intruders appear, the spiders will attempt to ensnare them in webs before closing in for melee combat. Nezznar joins the fray the round following the spiders' attack.

Should the doppelganger from Area 18 have retreated to this location, it assumes the appearance of Nundro Rockseeker, a dwarf, providing Nezznar with a facade to exploit as leverage for forcing the party's surrender (although the drow does not intend to harm the doppelganger). Refer to the "Roleplaying Nezznar" section for additional insight into the drow villain.

**Statue.** The statue represents Dumathoin, the dwarven god of mining. Any character proficient in Religion can readily identify the deity. The statue is masterfully carved, and the emerald eyes appear exceedingly valuable. However, a close examination and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveal that the gems are clever imitations crafted from worthless glass. Nevertheless, they are safeguarded by a potent spell, and a detect magic spell exposes a strong abjuration magic aura surrounding the statue. A character can scale the statue with ease and extract a jewel with a successful DC 10 Strength check. Yet, removing either eye triggers a calamity: the pillars lining the walls shatter, setting off a ceiling collapse. Every creature within the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in suffering 4d10 bludgeoning damage from falling debris and being knocked prone. Success entails taking only half the damage.

**Table.** The table is strewn with notes and maps, showcasing Nezznar's exploration efforts within the mine. Amid the paperwork lies a black leather sack containing treasure (see the "Treasure" section).

#### Roleplaying Nezznar

Despite his intentions to eliminate the characters, Nezznar is intrigued by them. If given the opportunity, he engages in extensive conversations with the characters to learn about their identities, allegiances, interests, and goals. He retains this information in his memory in the hopes of using it to his advantage in the future. Nezznar acknowledges being the Black Spider and confesses to using the Cragmaw goblins and the Redbrands to maintain Wave Echo Cave's secrecy. He will employ any means necessary to put the characters at ease, including making promises of surrender or proposing cooperation against the threats hindering his progress toward the Forge of Spells. However, he betrays the characters once they outlive their usefulness.

#### **Developments**

The creatures from Area 18 become aware of combat noises in this room. If they have not already been dealt with, they arrive after 3 rounds and act immediately after Nezznar's giant spiders in the initiative order.

If the characters capture Nezznar and deliver him to the town master's hall in Phandalin, the drow is imprisoned until Sildar Hallwinter or another representative of the Lords' Alliance can escort him to Neverwinter for justice and interrogation. However, unless the characters assign guards outside Nezznar's cell, Halia Thornton (see page 17) frees him from captivity, smuggles him out of Phandalin, and delivers him to the waiting hands of the Zhentarim. The Zhents are eager to learn everything Nezznar knows about Wave Echo Cave. Subsequent events involving Nezznar are at your discretion.

#### **Treasure**

Nezznar possesses a potion of healing and a spider staff. Additionally, he carries an iron key featuring an anvil-shaped head that unlocks the door to Area 20. Nezznar's explorations have yielded treasure, which is stored in the sack on the wooden table. The sack contains 190 electrum pieces (ep), 130 gold pieces (gp), 15 platinum pieces (pp), nine small gemstones (each valued at 10 gp), and a dwarven ale mug crafted from hammered electrum (valued at 100 gp).

#### **Awarding Experience Points**

If Nezznar is captured alive and handed over to Sildar Hallwinter or Townmaster Wester in Phandalin, award the party double his XP value.

### **20. Quarters of the Priests**

The entrance to this room is securely locked, necessitating the use of thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open. Nezznar (from Area 19) possesses the key.

Unless the characters are maintaining a stealthy approach, any activity at the door catches the attention of Nezznar and his comrades in Area 19, prompting the drow to dispatch his giant spiders to investigate.

The room is adorned with dusty draperies hanging along the walls. It also contains a bed and a brazier. On the cold stone floor lies a dwarf, his form badly disheveled, bound, and unconscious.

This chamber once belonged to the priest responsible for Dumathoin's temple (from Area 19), but Nezznar has seized it and repurposed it into a makeshift cell. The figure on the floor is Nundro, a dwarf commoner, and the youngest of the three Rockseeker brothers. Nezznar spared him due to suspicions that the dwarf might possess more knowledge about the mine than he was revealing. The drow has subjected Nundro to harsh interrogations once or twice daily since his capture.

**Developments**

If the adventurers successfully rescue Nundro, he expresses his gratitude and offers to accompany them during their stay in Wave Echo Cave. However, Nundro possesses limited knowledge of the mine's layout and can provide little useful information. Refer to the "NPC Party Members" sidebar (page 11) for guidance on role-playing Nundro.

Should the characters deal with Nezznar and his allies, this area provides a secure and comfortable place for them to rest before continuing their explorations within the mine.

**Awarding Experience Points**

If Nundro is rescued and survives the adventure, distribute 200 XP equally among the party members.

## **Conclusion**

Through their tireless efforts and a touch of luck, the adventurers have vanquished the Black Spider, thwarted his malevolent schemes, rid Phandalin of the threats posed by the ruffians, and reclaimed the long-lost mine of Wave Echo Cave. Their valorous deeds will be enshrined in the annals of this corner of the Sword Coast. In the years to come, the revitalized mines of the Phandelver's Pact will bring substantial wealth to Phandalin, fostering peace and prosperity in the region.

Gundren and Nundro Rockseeker take charge of the new mine's management. In gratitude for the adventurers' service to their family, they generously reward the party with a 10 percent share of the mine's profits. Whether the characters opt to settle in Phandalin, restore Tresendar Manor, or seek new adventures elsewhere, the local populace welcomes them with open arms.

By the culmination of this adventure, the characters should have reached the 5th level. If your players wish to continue with their characters, you can utilize the contents of this set to craft your adventures. The mysterious map found in Area 14 of Wave Echo Cave offers a potential adventure hook, but feel free to explore alternative ideas by leveraging the monsters, magic items, and locales within this adventure. If you intend to devise adventures for characters beyond the 5th level, you will require the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual.
