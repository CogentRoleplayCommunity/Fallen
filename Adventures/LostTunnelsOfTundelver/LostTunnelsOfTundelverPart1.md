# Chapter 1: Feral Arrows

To commence this adventure, the player characters find themselves on a mission to safeguard a wagon laden with essential provisions and supplies. Their journey unfolds as they navigate the route from the bustling city of Neverwinter towards the quaint town of Phandalin. This expedition leads them on a southward course along the well-trodden High Road, eventually intersecting with the eastward-bound Triboar Trail, depicted on the accompanying overland map. As they make their way through this picturesque landscape, with Phandalin tantalizingly close—just a half-day's march away—trouble rears its head in the form of a raiding party comprised of goblins hailing from the notorious Cragmaw tribe.

Now, when you're ready to initiate the adventure, read the enclosed text. Should you choose to devise an alternative story hook, proceed to the subsequent paragraph, and adapt the particulars to suit your narrative, disregarding any references to guiding the wagon.

```
Within the bustling urban sprawl of Neverwinter, a stout and bearded dwarf by the name of Gundren Rockseeker entrusted you with a significant task. He implored you to transport a wagon laden with vital supplies to the rugged settlement of Phandalin, located several days' journey to the southeast of the city. Gundren's demeanor was a curious blend of enthusiasm and secrecy, and he disclosed very little about the true nature of this venture. He merely divulged that he and his brothers had uncovered something of immense import. He promised a generous reward of ten gold pieces to each of you for ensuring the safe delivery of his provisions to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post nestled in the heart of Phandalin.

Intriguingly, Gundren and his warrior companion, Sildar Haliwinter, embarked on their journey ahead of your group, mounted on horses, and claimed they needed to arrive early to "attend to certain matters."

Your expedition has seen you trekking through the past few days, tracing the well-trodden path along the High Road, venturing southward from Neverwinter. As of late, you've taken a turn eastward onto the Triboar Trail. Thus far, your journey has been relatively uneventful, though this terrain is notorious for its perils. Bandits and outlaws are known to lurk along these very trails, making vigilance and caution imperative.
```

Before delving further into the adventure, take a few moments to engage the players in the following activities:

- **Character Introductions:** Encourage the players to introduce their characters to one another if they haven't done so already. This is an excellent opportunity for the players to share their characters' backgrounds, personalities, appearences, and motivations. It can help build a stronger sense of camaraderie within the party.
- **Character Connections to Gundren Rockseeker:** Have the players consider how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Encourage them to create their own stories, but offer suggestions if someone is struggling with ideas. For instance, Gundren could be a childhood friend, a mentor, or someone who aided the character in a difficult situation. This exercise allows players to contribute to the adventure's backstory and provides a more personalized connection to the quest.
- **Party's Marching Order:** Ask the players to determine the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Identify who's at the front and who's at the rear, and if the characters are escorting Gundren's wagon, clarify who's driving it. The remaining characters can decide whether they're riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead. This helps establish the group dynamics and tactics for the journey.

#### Driving the Wagon:

Any character within the party can take the reins and drive the wagon. No specific skill is required to do so. The wagon is pulled by two sturdy oxen, and if no one holds the reins, the oxen will come to a halt.

The wagon's cargo is a diverse assortment of mining supplies and foodstuffs, including a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, as well as shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen of each), along with five lanterns and a small barrel of oil (approximately fifty flasks in volume). The total value of this cargo is estimated at 100 bronze coins.

When you're prepared, proceed to the next section, "Goblin Arrows," to initiate the adventure.

## Feral Ambush

To initiate the encounter, please read the following text aloud:

```
Having journeyed along the Triboar Trail for approximately half a day, you round a bend and are confronted by a grim sight. There, about fifty feet ahead, lie two lifeless horses sprawled across the path. Each animal bears the unmistakable mark of several black-feathered arrows embedded in their flesh. The forest presses closely to the trail at this point, flanked by a steep embankment and thickets that seem impenetrable on either side.
```

For those adventurers using the 'Meet Me in Phandalin' adventure hook, a more detailed examination of the scene yields troubling discoveries. The deceased horses can be identified as the property of Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. Regrettably, they have been deceased for a day, their demise brought about by the very arrows that now pierce them.

```
As you inspect the area more closely, you find the saddlebags have been pillaged, and nearby rests an abandoned leather map case.
```

Amidst this eerie scene, concealed within the woods, lie four cunning goblins. Two lurk on each side of the road, biding their time until a curious soul approaches the horses, at which point they will launch a sudden attack.

Prepare for what may well become the initial skirmish in a series of battles within this adventure. Here are the guidelines to ensure a smooth encounter.:

If you would like to proceed with the guidelines for running the combat encounter, please let me know, and I'll provide the relevant information:

To effectively run the goblin encounter, follow these steps:

- Goblin Stat Block: Refer to the goblin character sheet. Make a note of their Stealth skill of 5d6.
- Determine Surprise: The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins may be able to surprise some or all of the characters. Roll a Stealth check for the goblins and comparing the result to the characters perception skill checks. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' Stealth check result is surprised and loses their turn during the first round of combat.
- Initiative: Use the initiative rules from the general rules to determine the order in which all characters and goblins act. Keep track of everyone's initiative count in the margins of your adventure book or on a separate piece of paper.
- Goblin Actions: When it's the goblins' turn to act, two of them should rush forward and make melee attacks, while the other two goblins stand about 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblin character sheet contains the necessary information to resolve their combat rolls.
- Fleeing Goblin: If three goblins are defeated, the last remaining goblin may attempt to flee, heading for the goblin trail.

#### Developments

**If the Goblins Defeat the Adventurers:**
In the unlikely event that the goblins manage to defeat the adventurers, they will leave them unconscious and loot both the party and the wagon. The goblins will then return to their Cragmaw hideout. The characters can choose to continue on to Phandalin, purchase new gear at Barthen's Provisions, and later return to the ambush site to find the goblins' trail.

**Capturing Goblins:**
Characters may decide to capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious rather than killing them. To do so, a character can use the "Render Unconcious" combat manuever or sum up 5d6 worth of injury. After a few minutes, a captured goblin regains consciousness and can be convinced to share what it knows (see "What the Goblins Know" sidebar). Additionally, the party can persuade the captured goblin to lead them to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps (see "Goblin Trail" section).

**Skipping the Goblin Trail:**
If the characters don't find the goblin trail or choose to continue to Phandalin, you can skip ahead to Part 2, "Phandalin." There, Elmar Barthen, the owner of Barthen's Provisions, will inform the characters that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived in Phandalin and suggest they return to the ambush site to investigate further after resting. Barthen can also point the party to Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster for more information on the goblin attacks.

**Resting:** After the goblin ambush, the party may require a rest depending on the outcome of the battle.

**Goblin Trail:**
If the characters defeat the goblins and inspect the area, they will discover signs that the goblins have used this location for staging ambushes. A hidden trail behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a CL 2 Survival check can determine that about a dozen goblins have traveled along this trail, along with signs of two humaniod-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site. The party can guide the wagon off the road and secure the oxen while pursuing the goblins down the trail, which leads five miles northwest to the Cragmaw hideout.

**Marching Order and Traps:**
Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as they move down the trail, as the order is vital. The goblins have set two traps to hinder pursuers:

* **Snare:** About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, the party may encounter a hidden snare. The character must succeed on a CL 2 Perception check to notice the trap. If not noticed, the character triggers the snare and must succeed on a CL 2 Acrobatics check. Failure results in the character being suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground, restrained until damage is dealt to the snare's cord, which causes it to drop. A character lowered down without care takes a Minor Injury from the fall.
* **Pit:** Another 10 minutes down the trail is a camouflaged pit. They must succeed on a CL 3 Perception check to spot the pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a CL 2 Acrobatics check to avoid falling in, taking a Minor Injury from bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to climb out.

### Awarding Skill Points

Overcoming the goblin ambush and finding the Cragmaw hideout nets each the player's 1 skill point to spend. Each player also gains a destiny point.

## Cragmaw Hideout

The goblin clan known as the Cragmaw has established a hidden base strategically positioned to harass and plunder traffic traversing the Triboar Trail or the route to Phandalin. The name "Cragmaw" stems from the tribe's practice of sharpening their teeth, giving them a menacing and jagged appearance. Leading the bandits in this lair is Klarg, a bugbear who takes orders from the chief of the Cragmaws, tasked with plundering any vulnerable caravans or travelers in the area. Recently, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle delivered new directives: Intercept the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone accompanying him.

### General Features

The Cragmaw cave ascends steeply, situated at the base of a substantial hill, with its caverns and passages embedded within the hill itself.

**Ceilings.** Ceilings throughout the complex are characterized by steep slopes, forming stalactite-laden vaults that reach heights of 20 to 30 feet above the ground.

**Lighting.** Lighting is absent in most areas, except for Locations 1 and 2, which are outdoors. Unless otherwise specified, the remainder of the complex is shrouded in darkness. The provided text for these locations assumes that characters possess either darkvision or a light source.

**Rubble.** Navigating through areas with crumbling rock and gravel poses a challenge, as they are classified as difficult terrain (refer to "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

**Sound.** The ambient sound of water within the cave serves to muffle noises, requiring attentive listening for creatures to detect activity. A Wisdom (Perception) check with a difficulty class of 15 enables creatures to attempt hearing nearby chamber sounds.

**Stalagmites.** Upthrust spires of rock, can offer cover as outlined in the general rules "Cover" section.

**Stream.** A shallow stream courses  through the complex, measuring only 2 feet in depth. The cold, slow-moving water facilitates easy wading for creatures moving through it.

```
What the Goblins know

In the event that the characters successfully capture or charm any of the goblins in this vicinity, they can coerce the goblins into revealing valuable details:

- The lair currently houses fewer than twenty goblins.

- The leader of the goblins is a bugbear named Klarg, who answers to King Grol, the chief of the Cragmaw tribe. King Grol resides in Cragmaw Castle, located approximately twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout within Neverwinter Wood.

- Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger conveyed that an entity known as the Black Spider was compensating the Cragmaws to monitor and apprehend the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker. The orders were to capture Gundren along with any possessions and deliver them to King Grol. Klarg adhered to these instructions, resulting in Gundren's ambush and subsequent capture, including a map in his possession.
 
- The dwarf and his map were successfully handed over to King Grol as per instructions. The dwarf's human companion is currently held captive in the "eating cave" (area 6).
```

### 1. Cave Mouth

The path from the goblin ambush site guides you to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout.

```
Tracing the goblins' path, you stumble upon a sizable cave nestled within a hillside, situated five miles from the ambush location. A meager stream emerges from the cave mouth, concealed by dense briar thickets. On the right side of the stream, a narrow dry path leads into the cave.
```

The thicket in area 2 proves impassable from the west side of the stream.

#### Developments

The goblins stationed in area 2 are tasked with keeping a vigilant watch on this vicinity, yet their attention appears to waver. (Goblins, being somewhat indolent, have a tendency to be lax in their duties.) However, should the characters generate considerable noise—such as engaging in heated debates, establishing a camp, clearing brush, and the like—the goblins in area 2 become alert and launch an attack through the thicket. The thicket provides the goblins with three-quarters cover, as detailed in the rulebook's section on cover rules.

### Goblin Blind

Upon crossing to the east side of the stream, characters gain a view beyond the screening thickets into area 2. This serves as a goblin guard post, though the occupants display signs of boredom and inattention.

```
On the eastern bank of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small section within the briar thickets has been carved out to create a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten the briars, offering space for guards to conceal themselves while surveilling the area—a pair of goblins currently lurk in this makeshift hideout.
```

If the two goblins become aware of intruders in area 1, they swiftly engage with their bows, shooting through the thickets and likely catching the characters off guard. In case the goblins remain oblivious to the adventurers in area 1 but spot them while crossing the stream, neither side gains the element of surprise.

Characters adopting a cautious approach or engaging in scouting may have an opportunity to surprise the goblin lookouts. For each character advancing ahead, a Stealth check can be made, contested by the goblins' Perception checks to avoid being caught off guard. Refer to the rulebook for detailed information on ability check contests.

**Thickets.** Thickets within the clearing function as difficult terrain, causing inconvenience without posing any direct danger. They grant half cover to creatures attacking through them, as explained in the "Difficult Terrain" and "Cover" sections of the general rules.

### 3. Kennel

Just inside the cave mouth, a set of uneven stone steps ascends to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage.

```
The cave gradually narrows into a steep fissure at its far end, permeated by the unmistakable stench of animals. The discordant symphony of savage snarls and the clinking of chains fills the air as two wolves, tethered by iron chains to rods embedded in stalagmites, guard the entrance.
```

The room houses three wolves in total. While they cannot reach targets standing on the steps, all three wolves aggressively attack any creature, except a goblin, that enters the room (refer to the "Developments" section). Nearby goblins, accustomed to the constant snapping and snarling of the wolves, pay little attention to the sounds of internal strife.

Any character attempting to calm the animals can make a CL Communication 3 check. Character's with that can speak Primal can reduce the CL by 1. If the wolves are provided with food, the CL is reduced by 1. A successful check allows the character to move freely within the room.

**Fissure.** An opening in the east wall leads to a narrow chimney that ascends 30 feet to area 8. The base of the fissure is cluttered with discarded rubbish from the opening above. Climbing or descending the chimney shaft requires a CL 2 Climb check. On a successful check, the character moves at once with their climbing speed. A result of CL 1 results in no gain or loss of ground, while a result of CL 0 causes the character to fall, incurring a bludgeon Minor Injury for first 10 feet fallen, with the injury increasing to a higher tier for ever additional 10 feet and landing prone at the base.

#### Developments

If the wolves are taunted by adversaries beyond their reach, they enter a frenzied state, attempting a single CL 3 Lift check each round any character remains in sight. Upon the first success, they loosen the rod, reducing the CL to 2. On a second success, they pull the rod free, bending it to liberate themselves. A goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.

### 4. Steep Passage

Beyond this point, characters without darkvision require a light source to navigate their surroundings.

```
The primary passage leading from the cave's entrance ascends steeply. On the west side, a lively stream cascades and gurgles down. Within the dim shadows, an adjacent passage extends westward, crossing over to the other side of the stream.
```

```
Adventure Maps

Maps found within this adventure are intended exclusively for the Dungeon Master's reference. These maps not only depict the entirety of an adventure location but also reveal concealed doors, hidden traps, and other elements meant to remain hidden from the players. Thus, the need for maintaining secrecy. Maps are particularly useful when presenting multiroom lairs and other expansive locales with numerous areas to explore. Consequently, not every locale necessitates a map.

When players reach a location indicated on a map, you can choose between providing a verbal description to help them form a mental image of the area or sketching what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, mirroring your map but selectively omitting details as needed.

Scale and Grid:
An established scale enables precise measurement of distances and dimensions, vital for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other aspects. Indoor maps are designed with grid squares that measure either 5 feet or 10 feet on each side.

Compass Rose:
A compass rose proves valuable when you need to describe locations. For instance, it aids in directing players to "barrels situated along the north wall" or "a staircase descending to the west."
```

Characters who employ light sources or rely on darkvision to peer further up the passage will discern the presence of a bridge at area 5. You can include this additional information:

```
In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge constructed from wood and rope, extending over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects with this one, situated twenty feet above the floor.
```

Any character capable of spotting the bridge in area 5 may also detect the presence of a goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so involves a Perception check pitted against the goblin's Stealth check result.

The goblin will become aware of the characters if they carry a light source or approach the bridge without using stealth. However, the goblin doesn't initiate an attack. Instead, it endeavors to slip away to the east to notify its companions in area 7 about the need to release a flood (refer to the "Flood!" section of area 5). The goblin manages to move without detection if its Stealth check surpasses the Perception check of any character who might otherwise notice its movements.

**Western Passage.** This passage is obstructed by rubble and features steep escarpments. Consider the area as difficult terrain, as described in "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook.

The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight exceeding 100 pounds destabilizes the entire mass, sending it tumbling to the east. Any creature on the ledge during its collapse must attempt a CL 2 Acrobatics Check. Failure results in taking a bludgeon Medium Injury, with a successful save reducing it to a bludgeon Minor Injuy. On a failed save, the creature also becomes prone, as outlined in "Prone" in the General Rules.

### 5. Overpass

In a section where an elevated tunnel intersects with the larger cavern beneath, goblins have established a guard post on a makeshift bridge.

```
The stream passage continues upward, navigating another set of uneven steps and veering eastward. The distant echoes of a waterfall resonate from a larger cavern up ahead.
```

If the characters missed the bridge in area 4, they now notice its presence. Here's the additional information:

```
A precarious bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels positioned 20 feet above the stream.
```

A goblin, currently hiding, stands watch on the bridge. Characters can spot it by succeeding on a Perception check contested by the goblin's Stealth check. This guard is lethargic and inattentive. In the absence of light sources, each character can attempt a Stealth check against the goblin's passive Perception score to slip by unnoticed.

If the goblin detects the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to initiate a flood (refer to the "Flood!" section) and then hurls javelins down at the characters.

**Bridge:** The bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It's feasible to climb from the lower passage to the bridge by scaling the rough, spray-slicked 20-foot-high walls, requiring a successful CL 3 Climb check. The bridge is connected by ropes which can be cut. If the ropes are cut, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a CL 2 Acrobatics Check or fall, taking bludgeon Medium Injury from and landing prone (refer to "Prone" in the general rules). Successful characters must then climb to safety.

Flood Alert! The large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be dislodged to release a surge of water down the main passage. In the round after the goblins in area 7 receive the signal from the lookout in area 5, they begin removing supports. On the goblins' initiative count in the subsequent round, a water surge rushes from area 7 down to area 1.

```
The tunnel resounds with a powerful roar as a substantial surge of water cascades from above.
```

All creatures in the tunnel are endangered. Characters on the bridge at area 5 or successfully climbing the cavern walls are exempt. Within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading to area 3, creatures can attempt a Acrobatics check to evade being swept away. A creature that fails can then attempt a CL 3 Climb check to cling on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and carried down to area 1, sustaining a bludgeon Minor Injury along the way. The goblins in area 7 can unleash a second flood by opening the second pool, but they refrain from doing so unless instructed by the goblin on the bridge. The goblin on the bridge waits to ascertain if the first flood has eliminated all intruders before signaling for the second release.

### 6. Verminkin Den

The hideout serves as a communal space and barracks for the Cragmaw raiders.

```
Within this expansive cave, a ten-foot-high escarpment divides it into upper and lower sections. A natural staircase ascends from the lower portion to the upper ledge, where the air is thick with the smoke of a cooking fire and tainted by the scent of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.
```

Six goblins inhabit this cavern, with one serving as their leader. The ordinary goblins tend to the cooking fire in the lower part, near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper section. Notably, Sildar Hallwinter, a captive human warrior, is held securely bound on the southern ledge, with 4 Minor Injuries from the goblins' relentless beatings.

The goblin leader, Yeemik, holds the second-in-command position in the hideout. If he perceives the characters gaining the upper hand, he seizes Sildar and drags him to the edge of the upper level, demanding a truce. Expressing his desire to overthrow Klarg and become the new boss, Yeemik proposes a parley. If the adventurers agree, he urges them to eliminate Klarg in area 8, promising Sildar's release upon returning with the bugbear’s head. However, Sildar warns against trusting the goblin, and rightly so. If the characters accept the deal, Yeemik attempts to coerce them into paying a hefty ransom for Sildar even after fulfilling their end of the bargain.

Should the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik forcibly shoves Sildar over the edge and proceeds with the fight. Sildar sustains a bludgeon Minor Injury from the fall, rendering him unconscious. Quick-thinking characters can try to stabilize him before he succumbs to death.

Sildar Hallwinter, a kindhearted human male with a place of honor in Waterdeep's famed griffon cavalry, is nearly fifty years old. As a member of the Lords’ Alliance, he is dedicated to ensuring the safety of cities and settlements. Accompanying Gundren Rockseeker to Phandalin, Sildar seeks to investigate the disappearance of Iarno Albrek, a fellow Alliance member. He provides valuable information to the characters, including details about the Rockseeker brothers' discovery of Wave Echo Cave, Klarg's orders to waylay Gundren, and the missing map indicating the secret location of the cave.

Additionally, Sildar reveals that Gundren's gear, along with his own, was taken to Cragmaw Castle. As an NPC party member, Sildar, if rescued and healed, remains with the party with the goal of reaching Phandalin as swiftly as possible. Although he lacks weapons or armor, he can wield a shortsword taken from a defeated goblin or provided by a character.

Yeemik carries a pouch with three small gold teeth (1 bc each) and 150 cc. The gear of Sildar and Gundren Rockseeker is located at Cragmaw Castle. For guidance on running NPC party members, refer to the "NPC Party Members" sidebar.

```
Guidelines for NPC Party Members:

- Grant the characters the authority to make significant decisions as they are the central figures in the adventure. If the characters seek advice or direction from an NPC party member, bear in mind that NPCs can make mistakes too.

- An NPC won't willingly put themselves in harm's way unless there's a valid reason to do so.

- Not all party members will be treated the same by an NPC, introducing enjoyable dynamics. As the NPC becomes acquainted with the characters, consider which ones they favor more and which ones they may not, allowing these preferences to influence interactions.

- Keep the NPC's actions in combat clear and straightforward. Additionally, explore non-combat roles for the NPC, such as stabilizing a dying character, guarding a prisoner, or assisting in barricading a door.

- NPCs possess their own lives and objectives. Therefore, an NPC should accompany the party only as long as it aligns with their goals and makes sense within the context of their story.
```

### 7. Twin Pools Cave

This cavern, altered by the goblins' actions, now features two large pools of water occupying half its space. A narrow waterfall descends from the eastern wall, feeding one pool, while the other drains out through the western end, forming the stream that exits the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls act as dams, controlling the water levels. An expansive exit lies to the south, and two smaller passages lead west. The constant noise of the waterfall reverberates, creating challenges for auditory perception. In this chamber, three goblins stand guard. If the goblin in area 5 has alerted the goblins here to the characters' presence, they are prepared for potential conflict. The waterfall's sound isolates this area from the adjacent one (area 8), preventing them from hearing each other. Thus, if combat erupts here, one goblin hastens to area 8 to warn Klarg.

**Rock Dams:** The goblins ingeniously constructed simple dams to manipulate the water flow through the heart of their complex. Should the goblin sentry in area 5 signal for the release of a flood, one or both pools may be nearly empty, allowing the stream to flow unimpeded.

### 8. Klargs Cave

Within the heart of the goblinoid hideout, Klarg, the leader, insists on hoarding the majority of the raiders' ill-gotten gains. The spoils from the Cragmaws' recent month of raiding and ambushing caravans are stockpiled in this den.

To the south end of this expansive cave, sacks and crates brimming with pilfered provisions form towering stacks. The floor slopes westward towards a narrow opening that descends into darkness, while a larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, with the distant roar of falling water filling the air. Amidst the cavern's center, the coals of a smoldering fire pit linger. Klarg, the bugbear warlord, shares this space with his mangy pet wolf, Ripper, and two goblins. Filled with grandiose delusions, Klarg perceives himself as a burgeoning conqueror. His eccentricity extends to referring to himself in the third person, declaring threats such as, "Who dares defy Klarg?" or "Klarg will build a throne from your bones, puny ones!" The goblins under his command, however, resent his tyrannical behavior.

* **Fire Pit:** Stepping into the central fire pit inflicts a fire Minor Injury damage to any creature, or fire Medium Injury if they fall prone. Each type of damage can only occur once per round.
* **Natural Chimney:** A niche in the western wall marks the top of a shaft descending 30 feet to area 3. Refer to that section for details on climbing the natural chimney.
* **Supplies:** Piles of sacks and crates offer partial cover to creatures using them for fighting or hiding. Most bear the symbol of a blue lion, representing the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company in Phandalin. Among the supplies, a hidden, unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg can be found (see the "Treasure" section). Characters searching the supplies will discover the chest.

#### **Developments:**

If warned by the goblins in area 7 about the hideout being under attack, Klarg and his wolf take cover behind stalagmites while the goblins hide behind the supply piles, hoping to ambush the intruders.

If Klarg is unaware of potential attackers, the characters have an opportunity to surprise him, particularly by climbing the chimney from area 3, an unexpected direction for an assault.

If the wolf is slain, Klarg attempts to descend the chimney to area 3 and flee the cave complex.

#### Treasure

The captured stores are voluminous, requiring a wagon for transportation. Returning the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, "Phandalin") results in a reward of 50 bc and the friendship of Linene and her company. Additionally, Klarg's treasure chest holds 600 cc, 11 bc, two vials of minor healing blood, and a jade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 bc). The small statuette can easily fit into a pocket or pouch.**

### What Comes Next?

The following leg of the journey unfolds in Phandalin, offering the adventurers several compelling reasons to visit the town:

* For those who embarked on the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, the characters can receive payment from Barthen's Provisions for delivering the wagonload of supplies.
* In the event of rescuing Sildar Hallwinter, the wounded warrior expresses gratitude and seeks an escort to Phandalin, offering a reward of 50 bc for the service.
* Personal backgrounds of the characters may lead them to specific NPCs in the town, adding layers to their individual narratives.

Players might also decide on alternative actions, such as pursuing Cragmaw Castle in part 3 of the adventure. In such cases, proceed directly to that section.

**Awarding Experience Points:**

The exploration of the Cragmaw hideout, along with the defeat of Klarg and his allies, marks a significant story milestone. Each character is granted 2 skill points.
