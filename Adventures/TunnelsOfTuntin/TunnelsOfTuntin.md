# Chapter 1: Feral Arrows

To commence this adventure, the player characters find themselves on a mission to safeguard a wagon laden with essential provisions and supplies. Their journey unfolds as they navigate the route from the bustling city of Neverwinter towards the quaint town of Phandalin. This expedition leads them on a southward course along the well-trodden High Road, eventually intersecting with the eastward-bound Triboar Trail, depicted on the accompanying overland map. As they make their way through this picturesque landscape, with Phandalin tantalizingly close—just a half-day's march away—trouble rears its head in the form of a raiding party comprised of goblins hailing from the notorious Cragmaw tribe.

Now, when you're ready to initiate the adventure, read the enclosed text. Should you choose to devise an alternative story hook, proceed to the subsequent paragraph, and adapt the particulars to suit your narrative, disregarding any references to guiding the wagon.

```

Within the bustling urban sprawl of Neverwinter, a stout and bearded dwarf by the name of Gundren Rockseeker entrusted you with a significant task. He implored you to transport a wagon laden with vital supplies to the rugged settlement of Phandalin, located several days' journey to the southeast of the city. Gundren's demeanor was a curious blend of enthusiasm and secrecy, and he disclosed very little about the true nature of this venture. He merely divulged that he and his brothers had uncovered something of immense import. He promised a generous reward of ten gold pieces to each of you for ensuring the safe delivery of his provisions to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post nestled in the heart of Phandalin.

Intriguingly, Gundren and his warrior companion, Sildar Haliwinter, embarked on their journey ahead of your group, mounted on horses, and claimed they needed to arrive early to "attend to certain matters."

Your expedition has seen you trekking through the past few days, tracing the well-trodden path along the High Road, venturing southward from Neverwinter. As of late, you've taken a turn eastward onto the Triboar Trail. Thus far, your journey has been relatively uneventful, though this terrain is notorious for its perils. Bandits and outlaws are known to lurk along these very trails, making vigilance and caution imperative.

Before delving further into the adventure, take a few moments to engage the players in the following activities:

1. **Character Introductions:** Encourage the players to introduce their characters to one another if they haven't done so already. This is an excellent opportunity for the players to share their characters' backgrounds, personalities, appearences, and motivations. It can help build a stronger sense of camaraderie within the party.
2. **Character Connections to Gundren Rockseeker:** Have the players consider how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Encourage them to create their own stories, but offer suggestions if someone is struggling with ideas. For instance, Gundren could be a childhood friend, a mentor, or someone who aided the character in a difficult situation. This exercise allows players to contribute to the adventure's backstory and provides a more personalized connection to the quest.
3. **Party's Marching Order:** Ask the players to determine the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Identify who's at the front and who's at the rear, and if the characters are escorting Gundren's wagon, clarify who's driving it. The remaining characters can decide whether they're riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead. This helps establish the group dynamics and tactics for the journey.

#### Driving the Wagon:

Any character within the party can take the reins and drive the wagon. No specific skill is required to do so. The wagon is pulled by two sturdy oxen, and if no one holds the reins, the oxen will come to a halt.

The wagon's cargo is a diverse assortment of mining supplies and foodstuffs, including a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, as well as shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen of each), along with five lanterns and a small barrel of oil (approximately fifty flasks in volume). The total value of this cargo is estimated at 100 gold pieces.

When you're prepared, proceed to the next section, "Goblin Arrows," to initiate the adventure.

## Feral Ambush

To kick off the encounter, read the following boxed text to set the scene:

```
You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.
```

If you are using the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They've been dead about a day, and it's clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:

```
The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.
```

Four **goblins** are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.

This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:"

If you would like to proceed with the guidelines for running the combat encounter, please let me know, and I'll provide the relevant information:

To effectively run the goblin encounter, follow these steps:

- Goblin Stat Block: Refer to the goblin stat block in Appendix B for their statistics and abilities. Make a note of their Stealth skill of 5d6.
- Determine Surprise: The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins may be able to surprise some or all of the characters. Roll a Stealth check for the goblins and comparing the result to the characters perception skill checks. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' Stealth check result is surprised and loses their turn during the first round of combat.
- !Initiative: Use the initiative rules from the rulebook to determine the order in which all characters and goblins act. Keep track of everyone's initiative count in the margins of your adventure book or on a separate piece of paper.
- Goblin Actions: When it's the goblins' turn to act, two of them should rush forward and make melee attacks, while the other two goblins stand about 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblin stat block contains the necessary information to resolve these attacks. For more details on what the goblins can do on their turn, refer to Chapter 2, "Combat," in the rulebook.
- Fleeing Goblin: If three goblins are defeated, the last remaining goblin may attempt to flee, heading for the goblin trail.

Here are the further developments in the adventure after the goblin ambush and some additional details:

**If the Goblins Defeat the Adventurers:**
In the unlikely event that the goblins manage to defeat the adventurers, they will leave them unconscious and loot both the party and the wagon. The goblins will then return to their Cragmaw hideout. The characters can choose to continue on to Phandalin, purchase new gear at Barthen's Provisions, and later return to the ambush site to find the goblins' trail.

**Capturing Goblins:**
Characters may decide to capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious rather than killing them. To do so, a character can use the "Render Unconcious" combat manuever or sum up 5d6 worth of injury. After a few minutes, a captured goblin regains consciousness and can be convinced to share what it knows (see "What the Goblins Know" sidebar). Additionally, the party can persuade the captured goblin to lead them to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps (see "Goblin Trail" section).

**Skipping the Goblin Trail:**
If the characters don't find the goblin trail or choose to continue to Phandalin, you can skip ahead to Part 2, "Phandalin." There, Elmar Barthen, the owner of Barthen's Provisions, will inform the characters that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived in Phandalin and suggest they return to the ambush site to investigate further after resting. Barthen can also point the party to Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster for more information on the goblin attacks.

**Resting:** After the goblin ambush, the party may require a rest depending on the outcome of the battle.

**Goblin Trail:**
If the characters defeat the goblins and inspect the area, they will discover signs that the goblins have used this location for staging ambushes. A hidden trail behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a CL 2 Survival check can determine that about a dozen goblins have traveled along this trail, along with signs of two humaniod-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site. The party can guide the wagon off the road and secure the oxen while pursuing the goblins down the trail, which leads five miles northwest to the Cragmaw hideout.

**Marching Order and Traps:**
Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as they move down the trail, as the order is vital. The goblins have set two traps to hinder pursuers:

* **Snare:** About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, the party may encounter a hidden snare. The character must succeed on a CL 2 Perception check to notice the trap. If not noticed, the character triggers the snare and must succeed on a CL 2 Acrobatics check. Failure results in the character being suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground, restrained until damage is dealt to the snare's cord, which causes it to drop. A character lowered down without care takes a Minor Injury from the fall.
  
* **Pit:** Another 10 minutes down the trail is a camouflaged pit. They must succeed on a CL 3 Perception check to spot the pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a CL 2 Acrobatics check to avoid falling in, taking a Minor Injury from bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to climb out.
