# Chapter 1: Feral Arrows

To commence this adventure, the player characters find themselves on a mission to safeguard a wagon laden with essential provisions and supplies. Their journey unfolds as they navigate the route from the bustling city of Neverwinter towards the quaint town of Phandalin. This expedition leads them on a southward course along the well-trodden High Road, eventually intersecting with the eastward-bound Triboar Trail, depicted on the accompanying overland map. As they make their way through this picturesque landscape, with Phandalin tantalizingly close—just a half-day's march away—trouble rears its head in the form of a raiding party comprised of goblins hailing from the notorious Cragmaw tribe.

Now, when you're ready to initiate the adventure, read the enclosed text. Should you choose to devise an alternative story hook, proceed to the subsequent paragraph, and adapt the particulars to suit your narrative, disregarding any references to guiding the wagon.

Within the bustling urban sprawl of Neverwinter, a stout and bearded dwarf by the name of Gundren Rockseeker entrusted you with a significant task. He implored you to transport a wagon laden with vital supplies to the rugged settlement of Phandalin, located several days' journey to the southeast of the city. Gundren's demeanor was a curious blend of enthusiasm and secrecy, and he disclosed very little about the true nature of this venture. He merely divulged that he and his brothers had uncovered something of immense import. He promised a generous reward of ten gold pieces to each of you for ensuring the safe delivery of his provisions to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post nestled in the heart of Phandalin.

Intriguingly, Gundren and his warrior companion, Sildar Haliwinter, embarked on their journey ahead of your group, mounted on horses, and claimed they needed to arrive early to "attend to certain matters."

Your expedition has seen you trekking through the past few days, tracing the well-trodden path along the High Road, venturing southward from Neverwinter. As of late, you've taken a turn eastward onto the Triboar Trail. Thus far, your journey has been relatively uneventful, though this terrain is notorious for its perils. Bandits and outlaws are known to lurk along these very trails, making vigilance and caution imperative.

Before delving further into the adventure, take a few moments to engage the players in the following activities:

1. **Character Introductions:** Encourage the players to introduce their characters to one another if they haven't done so already. This is an excellent opportunity for the players to share their characters' backgrounds, personalities, appearences, and motivations. It can help build a stronger sense of camaraderie within the party.
2. **Character Connections to Gundren Rockseeker:** Have the players consider how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Encourage them to create their own stories, but offer suggestions if someone is struggling with ideas. For instance, Gundren could be a childhood friend, a mentor, or someone who aided the character in a difficult situation. This exercise allows players to contribute to the adventure's backstory and provides a more personalized connection to the quest.
3. **Party's Marching Order:** Ask the players to determine the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Identify who's at the front and who's at the rear, and if the characters are escorting Gundren's wagon, clarify who's driving it. The remaining characters can decide whether they're riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead. This helps establish the group dynamics and tactics for the journey.

#### Driving the Wagon:

Any character within the party can take the reins and drive the wagon. No specific skill is required to do so. The wagon is pulled by two sturdy oxen, and if no one holds the reins, the oxen will come to a halt.

The wagon's cargo is a diverse assortment of mining supplies and foodstuffs, including a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, as well as shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen of each), along with five lanterns and a small barrel of oil (approximately fifty flasks in volume). The total value of this cargo is estimated at 100 gold pieces.

When you're prepared, proceed to the next section, "Goblin Arrows," to initiate the adventure.

## Feral Ambush

To kick off the encounter, read the following boxed text to set the scene:

```
You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.
```

If you are using the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They've been dead about a day, and it's clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:

```
The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.
```

Four **goblins** are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.

This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:"
