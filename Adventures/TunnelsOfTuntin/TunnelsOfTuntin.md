# Chapter 1: Feral Arrows

To commence this adventure, the player characters find themselves on a mission to safeguard a wagon laden with essential provisions and supplies. Their journey unfolds as they navigate the route from the bustling city of Neverwinter towards the quaint town of Phandalin. This expedition leads them on a southward course along the well-trodden High Road, eventually intersecting with the eastward-bound Triboar Trail, depicted on the accompanying overland map. As they make their way through this picturesque landscape, with Phandalin tantalizingly close—just a half-day's march away—trouble rears its head in the form of a raiding party comprised of goblins hailing from the notorious Cragmaw tribe.

Now, when you're ready to initiate the adventure, read the enclosed text. Should you choose to devise an alternative story hook, proceed to the subsequent paragraph, and adapt the particulars to suit your narrative, disregarding any references to guiding the wagon.

```

Within the bustling urban sprawl of Neverwinter, a stout and bearded dwarf by the name of Gundren Rockseeker entrusted you with a significant task. He implored you to transport a wagon laden with vital supplies to the rugged settlement of Phandalin, located several days' journey to the southeast of the city. Gundren's demeanor was a curious blend of enthusiasm and secrecy, and he disclosed very little about the true nature of this venture. He merely divulged that he and his brothers had uncovered something of immense import. He promised a generous reward of ten gold pieces to each of you for ensuring the safe delivery of his provisions to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post nestled in the heart of Phandalin.

Intriguingly, Gundren and his warrior companion, Sildar Haliwinter, embarked on their journey ahead of your group, mounted on horses, and claimed they needed to arrive early to "attend to certain matters."

Your expedition has seen you trekking through the past few days, tracing the well-trodden path along the High Road, venturing southward from Neverwinter. As of late, you've taken a turn eastward onto the Triboar Trail. Thus far, your journey has been relatively uneventful, though this terrain is notorious for its perils. Bandits and outlaws are known to lurk along these very trails, making vigilance and caution imperative.
```

Before delving further into the adventure, take a few moments to engage the players in the following activities:

1. **Character Introductions:** Encourage the players to introduce their characters to one another if they haven't done so already. This is an excellent opportunity for the players to share their characters' backgrounds, personalities, appearences, and motivations. It can help build a stronger sense of camaraderie within the party.
2. **Character Connections to Gundren Rockseeker:** Have the players consider how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Encourage them to create their own stories, but offer suggestions if someone is struggling with ideas. For instance, Gundren could be a childhood friend, a mentor, or someone who aided the character in a difficult situation. This exercise allows players to contribute to the adventure's backstory and provides a more personalized connection to the quest.
3. **Party's Marching Order:** Ask the players to determine the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Identify who's at the front and who's at the rear, and if the characters are escorting Gundren's wagon, clarify who's driving it. The remaining characters can decide whether they're riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead. This helps establish the group dynamics and tactics for the journey.

#### Driving the Wagon:

Any character within the party can take the reins and drive the wagon. No specific skill is required to do so. The wagon is pulled by two sturdy oxen, and if no one holds the reins, the oxen will come to a halt.

The wagon's cargo is a diverse assortment of mining supplies and foodstuffs, including a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, as well as shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen of each), along with five lanterns and a small barrel of oil (approximately fifty flasks in volume). The total value of this cargo is estimated at 100 gold pieces.

When you're prepared, proceed to the next section, "Goblin Arrows," to initiate the adventure.

## Feral Ambush

To kick off the encounter, read the following boxed text to set the scene:

```
You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.
```

If you are using the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They've been dead about a day, and it's clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:

```
The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.
```

Four **goblins** are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.

This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:"

If you would like to proceed with the guidelines for running the combat encounter, please let me know, and I'll provide the relevant information:

To effectively run the goblin encounter, follow these steps:

- Goblin Stat Block: Refer to the goblin stat block in Appendix B for their statistics and abilities. Make a note of their Stealth skill of 5d6.
- Determine Surprise: The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins may be able to surprise some or all of the characters. Roll a Stealth check for the goblins and comparing the result to the characters perception skill checks. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' Stealth check result is surprised and loses their turn during the first round of combat.
- !Initiative: Use the initiative rules from the rulebook to determine the order in which all characters and goblins act. Keep track of everyone's initiative count in the margins of your adventure book or on a separate piece of paper.
- Goblin Actions: When it's the goblins' turn to act, two of them should rush forward and make melee attacks, while the other two goblins stand about 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblin stat block contains the necessary information to resolve these attacks. For more details on what the goblins can do on their turn, refer to Chapter 2, "Combat," in the rulebook.
- Fleeing Goblin: If three goblins are defeated, the last remaining goblin may attempt to flee, heading for the goblin trail.

Here are the further developments in the adventure after the goblin ambush and some additional details:

**If the Goblins Defeat the Adventurers:**
In the unlikely event that the goblins manage to defeat the adventurers, they will leave them unconscious and loot both the party and the wagon. The goblins will then return to their Cragmaw hideout. The characters can choose to continue on to Phandalin, purchase new gear at Barthen's Provisions, and later return to the ambush site to find the goblins' trail.

**Capturing Goblins:**
Characters may decide to capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious rather than killing them. To do so, a character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious. The attack should deal enough damage to reduce the goblin's hit points to 0. After a few minutes, a captured goblin regains consciousness and can be convinced to share what it knows (see "What the Goblins Know" sidebar). Additionally, the party can persuade the captured goblin to lead them to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps (see "Goblin Trail" section).

**Skipping the Goblin Trail:**
If the characters don't find the goblin trail or choose to continue to Phandalin, you can skip ahead to Part 2, "Phandalin." There, Elmar Barthen, the owner of Barthen's Provisions, will inform the characters that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived in Phandalin and suggest they return to the ambush site to investigate further after resting. Barthen can also point the party to Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster for more information on the goblin attacks.

**Resting:** After the goblin ambush, the party may require a rest depending on the outcome of the battle. You can refer to the rulebook for more information on short rests and long rests to determine how and when the party can recover.

**Goblin Trail:**
If the characters defeat the goblins and inspect the area, they will discover signs that the goblins have used this location for staging ambushes. A hidden trail behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can determine that about a dozen goblins have traveled along this trail, along with signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site. The party can guide the wagon off the road and secure the oxen while pursuing the goblins down the trail, which leads five miles northwest to the Cragmaw hideout.

**Marching Order and Traps:**
Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as they move down the trail, as the order is vital. The goblins have set two traps to hinder pursuers:

* **Snare:** About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, the party may encounter a hidden snare. The character in the lead can spot the trap automatically if their passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If not noticed, the character triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in the character being suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground, restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare's cord, which causes it to drop. A character lowered down without care takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.
* **Pit:** Another 10 minutes down the trail is a camouflaged pit. The character in the lead spots the pit automatically if their passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to climb out.

### Awarding Skill Points

  Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 1 Skill Point. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.

## Cragmaw Hideout

  The goblin clan known as the Cragmaw has established a hidden base strategically positioned to harass and plunder traffic traversing the Triboar Trail or the route to Phandalin. The name "Cragmaw" stems from the tribe's practice of sharpening their teeth, giving them a menacing and jagged appearance. Leading the bandits in this lair is Klarg, a bugbear who takes orders from the chief of the Cragmaws, tasked with plundering any vulnerable caravans or travelers in the area. Recently, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle delivered new directives: Intercept the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone accompanying him.

### General Features

The Cragmaw cave ascends steeply, situated at the base of a substantial hill, with its caverns and passages embedded within the hill itself. Ceilings throughout the complex are characterized by steep slopes, forming stalactite-laden vaults that reach heights of 20 to 30 feet above the ground. Lighting is absent in most areas, except for Locations 1 and 2, which are outdoors. Unless otherwise specified, the remainder of the complex is shrouded in darkness. The provided text for these locations assumes that characters possess either darkvision or a light source.

Navigating through areas with crumbling rock and gravel poses a challenge, as they are classified as difficult terrain (refer to "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook). The ambient sound of water within the cave serves to muffle noises, requiring attentive listening for creatures to detect activity. A Wisdom (Perception) check with a difficulty class of 15 enables creatures to attempt hearing nearby chamber sounds.

Stalagmites, upthrust spires of rock, can offer cover as outlined in the rulebook's "Cover" section. Additionally, a shallow stream courses  through the complex, measuring only 2 feet in depth. The cold, slow-moving water facilitates easy wading for creatures moving through it.

```
 What the Goblins know
In the event that the characters successfully capture or charm any of the goblins in this vicinity, they can coerce the goblins into revealing valuable details:The lair currently houses fewer than twenty goblins.The leader of the goblins is a bugbear named Klarg, who answers to King Grol, the chief of the Cragmaw tribe. King Grol resides in Cragmaw Castle, located approximately twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout within Neverwinter Wood. Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger conveyed that an entity known as the Black Spider was compensating the Cragmaws to monitor and apprehend the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker. The orders were to capture Gundren along with any possessions and deliver them to King Grol. Klarg adhered to these instructions, resulting in Gundren's ambush and subsequent capture, including a map in his possession. The dwarf and his map were successfully handed over to King Grol as per instructions. The dwarf's human companion is currently held captive in the "eating cave" (area 6).
```

### Cave Entry Point

The path from the goblin ambush site guides you to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout.
Tracing the goblins' path, you stumble upon a sizable cave nestled within a hillside, situated five miles from the ambush location. A meager stream emerges from the cave mouth, concealed by dense briar thickets. On the right side of the stream, a narrow dry path leads into the cave. The thicket in area 2 proves impassable from the west side of the stream.

The goblins stationed in area 2 are tasked with keeping a vigilant watch on this vicinity, yet their attention appears to waver. (Goblins, being somewhat indolent, have a tendency to be lax in their duties.) However, should the characters generate considerable noise—such as engaging in heated debates, establishing a camp, clearing brush, and the like—the goblins in area 2 become alert and launch an attack through the thicket. The thicket provides the goblins with three-quarters cover, as detailed in the rulebook's section on cover rules.

### Goblin Watchpost

Upon crossing to the east side of the stream, characters gain a view beyond the screening thickets into area 2. This serves as a goblin guard post, though the occupants display signs of boredom and inattention. On the eastern bank of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small section within the briar thickets has been carved out to create a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten the briars, offering space for guards to conceal themselves while surveilling the area—a pair of goblins currently lurk in this makeshift hideout. If the goblins become aware of intruders in area 1, they swiftly engage with their bows, shooting through the thickets and likely catching the characters off guard. In case the goblins remain oblivious to the adventurers in area 1 but spot them while crossing the stream, neither side gains the element of surprise.

Characters adopting a cautious approach or engaging in scouting may have an opportunity to surprise the goblin lookouts. For each character advancing ahead, a Dexterity (Stealth) check can be made, contested by the goblins' passive Wisdom (Perception) score to avoid being caught off guard. Refer to the rulebook for detailed information on ability check contests.

Thickets within the clearing function as difficult terrain, causing inconvenience without posing any direct danger. They grant half cover to creatures attacking through them, as explained in the "Difficult Terrain" and "Cover" sections of the rulebook.

### Kennel

Just inside the cave mouth, a set of uneven stone steps ascends to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave gradually narrows into a steep fissure at its far end, permeated by the unmistakable stench of animals. The discordant symphony of savage snarls and the clinking of chains fills the air as two wolves, tethered by iron chains to rods embedded in stalagmites, guard the entrance. The room houses three wolves in total. While they cannot reach targets standing on the steps, all three wolves aggressively attack any creature, except a goblin, that enters the room (refer to the "Developments" section). Nearby goblins, accustomed to the constant snapping and snarling of the wolves, pay little attention to the sounds of internal strife.

Any character attempting to calm the animals can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. A successful check allows the character to move freely within the room. If the wolves are provided with food, the DC reduces to 10.

Fissure Feature
An opening in the east wall leads to a narrow chimney that ascends 30 feet to area 8. The base of the fissure is cluttered with discarded rubbish from the opening above. Climbing or descending the chimney shaft requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the character moves at half speed as desired. A result of 6-9 results in no gain or loss of ground, while a result of 5 or less causes the character to fall, incurring 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen and landing prone at the base.

Developments
If the wolves are taunted by adversaries beyond their reach, they enter a frenzied state, attempting a single DC 15 Strength check each round any character remains in sight. Upon the first success, they loosen the rod, reducing the DC to 10. On a second success, they pull the rod free, bending it to liberate themselves. A goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.

### Steep Passage

From this point on, characters without darkvision will need light to see their surroundings.

```
The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.
```

Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at area 5. Add:

```
In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make
out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope
crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage
intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.
```

Any character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check result. The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don’t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the “Flood!” section of area 5). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.

**Western Passage.** This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments. Treat the area as difficult terrain (see “Difficult Terrain” in the rulebook). The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The creature also falls prone on a failed save (see “Being Prone” in the rulebook).

## 5. Overpass

In a section where an elevated tunnel intersects with the larger cavern beneath, goblins have established a guard post on a makeshift bridge. 



```
The stream passage continues upward, navigating another set of uneven steps and veering eastward. The distant echoes of a waterfall resonate from a larger cavern up ahead.
```

If the characters missed the bridge in area 4, they now notice its presence. Here's the additional information:

```
A precarious bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels positioned 20 feet above the stream.
```

A goblin, currently hiding, stands watch on the bridge. Characters can spot it by succeeding on a Perception check contested by the goblin's Stealth check. This guard is lethargic and inattentive. In the absence of light sources, each character can attempt a Stealth check against the goblin's passive Perception score to slip by unnoticed.

If the goblin detects the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to initiate a flood (refer to the "Flood!" section) and then hurls javelins down at the characters.

**Bridge:** The bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It's feasible to climb from the lower passage to the bridge by scaling the rough, spray-slicked 20-foot-high walls, requiring a successful CL 3 Climb check. The bridge is connected by ropes which can be cut. If the ropes are cut, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a CL 2 Acrobatics Check or fall, taking bludgeon Medium Injury from and landing prone (refer to "Prone" in the general rules). Successful characters must then climb to safety.

Flood Alert! The large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be dislodged to release a surge of water down the main passage. In the round after the goblins in area 7 receive the signal from the lookout in area 5, they begin removing supports. On the goblins' initiative count in the subsequent round, a water surge rushes from area 7 down to area 1.

```
The tunnel resounds with a powerful roar as a substantial surge of water cascades from above.
```

All creatures in the tunnel are endangered. Characters on the bridge at area 5 or successfully climbing the cavern walls are exempt. Within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading to area 3, creatures can attempt a Acrobatics check to evade being swept away. A creature that fails can then attempt a CL 3 Climb check to cling on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and carried down to area 1, sustaining a bludgeon Minor Injury along the way. The goblins in area 7 can unleash a second flood by opening the second pool, but they refrain from doing so unless instructed by the goblin on the bridge. The goblin on the bridge waits to ascertain if the first flood has eliminated all intruders before signaling for the second release.

### 6. Verminkin Den

The hideout serves as a communal space and barracks for the Cragmaw raiders.

```
Within this expansive cave, a ten-foot-high escarpment divides it into upper and lower sections. A natural staircase ascends from the lower portion to the upper ledge, where the air is thick with the smoke of a cooking fire and tainted by the scent of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.
```

Six goblins inhabit this cavern, with one serving as their leader. The ordinary goblins tend to the cooking fire in the lower part, near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper section. Notably, Sildar Hallwinter, a captive human warrior, is held securely bound on the southern ledge, with 4 Minor Injuries from the goblins' relentless beatings.

The goblin leader, Yeemik, holds the second-in-command position in the hideout. If he perceives the characters gaining the upper hand, he seizes Sildar and drags him to the edge of the upper level, demanding a truce. Expressing his desire to overthrow Klarg and become the new boss, Yeemik proposes a parley. If the adventurers agree, he urges them to eliminate Klarg in area 8, promising Sildar's release upon returning with the bugbear’s head. However, Sildar warns against trusting the goblin, and rightly so. If the characters accept the deal, Yeemik attempts to coerce them into paying a hefty ransom for Sildar even after fulfilling their end of the bargain.

Should the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik forcibly shoves Sildar over the edge and proceeds with the fight. Sildar sustains a bludgeon Minor Injury from the fall, rendering him unconscious. Quick-thinking characters can try to stabilize him before he succumbs to death.

Sildar Hallwinter, a kindhearted human male with a place of honor in Waterdeep's famed griffon cavalry, is nearly fifty years old. As a member of the Lords’ Alliance, he is dedicated to ensuring the safety of cities and settlements. Accompanying Gundren Rockseeker to Phandalin, Sildar seeks to investigate the disappearance of Iarno Albrek, a fellow Alliance member. He provides valuable information to the characters, including details about the Rockseeker brothers' discovery of Wave Echo Cave, Klarg's orders to waylay Gundren, and the missing map indicating the secret location of the cave.

Additionally, Sildar reveals that Gundren's gear, along with his own, was taken to Cragmaw Castle. As an NPC party member, Sildar, if rescued and healed, remains with the party with the goal of reaching Phandalin as swiftly as possible. Although he lacks weapons or armor, he can wield a shortsword taken from a defeated goblin or provided by a character.

Yeemik carries a pouch with three small gold teeth (1 bc each) and 150 cc. The gear of Sildar and Gundren Rockseeker is located at Cragmaw Castle. For guidance on running NPC party members, refer to the "NPC Party Members" sidebar.

```
Guidelines for NPC Party Members:

- Grant the characters the authority to make significant decisions as they are the central figures in the adventure. If the characters seek advice or direction from an NPC party member, bear in mind that NPCs can make mistakes too.

- An NPC won't willingly put themselves in harm's way unless there's a valid reason to do so.

- Not all party members will be treated the same by an NPC, introducing enjoyable dynamics. As the NPC becomes acquainted with the characters, consider which ones they favor more and which ones they may not, allowing these preferences to influence interactions.

- Keep the NPC's actions in combat clear and straightforward. Additionally, explore non-combat roles for the NPC, such as stabilizing a dying character, guarding a prisoner, or assisting in barricading a door.

- NPCs possess their own lives and objectives. Therefore, an NPC should accompany the party only as long as it aligns with their goals and makes sense within the context of their story.
