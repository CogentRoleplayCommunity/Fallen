### The Spore

The spore is an insidious parasitic fungus that exerts control over the brainstem of its unfortunate victims. Manifesting as a vibrant, luminous whitish-blue fungus, it releases airborne spores into the environment. Inhalation of even a small quantity of these spores leads to death within 1-3 months, while exposure to a significant amount results in rapid demise within a day to just a few minutes.

Once deceased, there follows a peculiar 36-hour hibernation period, after which the deceased individuals awaken and embark on a relentless quest to infect new victims. Over time, the fungus gradually emerges from the decaying host, seeking a high vantage point from which to disperse its spores far and wide.

During their dormant state, these infected individuals are referred to as carriers, serving as unwitting vessels for the propagation of the spore.
