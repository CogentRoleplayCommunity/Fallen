# Crossbreed

![alt_text](Crossbreed.png)

Crossbreeds trace their monstrous ancestry from the ancient monsters that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were grafted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord. However, due to the dilution and mixing of their ancestral bloodlines, the genetic gifts are lost to them. They are often referred to as mudbloods due to their impure bloodlines.

Some bloodlines become impure in a single generation while others take many generations.

Mudbloods make up a large percentage of the population of Terra. Due to their impure bloodline, they are often of a lower class as many of the aristocratic societies across Terra hold deep seeded prejudice against them. While some rise above the prejudice and obtain wealth, status and fame, most live as mundane farmers and peasants. The only Crossbreeds of aristocratic status were great houses where their bloodlines slowly became impure.
