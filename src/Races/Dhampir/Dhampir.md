# Dhampir

Dhampirs trace their monstrous ancestry from the Vampires that bowed to the Bright Lord. Sunlight is deadly to Vampires, meaning those that stood in front of the Bright Lord surely should have perished…

 While Vampires have a powerful aversion to sunlight, dhampirs are unaffected. Also referred to as “Day Walkers”, their distinctive physical attributes include pointy ears, elongated canines, and their distinctive faintly glowing eyes.

Reddland is the largest Dhampir kingdom on the eastern edge of Terra. Reddlandians are a fiercely proud people, ruled by house Reddington. Their standing military, “The Red Legion'' is one of the finest armies on Terra and the recent discovery of Blood Healing has made Reddland a key player in global politics.

Reddland has become a powerful political player as during the Spore pandemic that ravaged the continent, it was their healing bloods that cured the fungal plague that ravaged the continent.
