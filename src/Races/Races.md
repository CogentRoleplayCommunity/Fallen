### Fellkin

Fellkin trace their ancestry to the monster the bowed before the Bright Lord during the Awakening.

Fellkin vary wildly, but all share the inate risk of going feral. This occurs when a continously Fellkin feeds on another Fellkin, resulting in madness and increased monsterous traits. While this can be a temporary affliction in mild cases, many never recover....
