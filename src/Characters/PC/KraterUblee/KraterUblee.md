## Backstory

Flaws: Krater is stubborn and finds it difficult to compromise. He gets tunnelvision.

Krater grew up in the vast Ironwood forest to the east of Reddwall known as Irongrove. His family worked at one of the remote lumberyards responsible for the harvesting and exporting of ironwood. Tradgedy struck Karter's family when he was but a boy, when his father was killed in a tragic accident. Left without a father figure, Burrow Bard Stoneseeker, the owener and financer of the lumberyard opperation took Krater under his wing the best he could. Krater emmulated his now father figure, becoming increasly stubborn and difficult to compromise with.

Karter grew to be quite the lumberman and proficent with his axe, working hard and always meeting quota. When his mother's health began deterioating, he saved his salary, enough to eventually move him and his mom towards Reddwall to seek better healthcare for his mother's strange disease. Burrowbard, kind as ever, helped them find a place, haggle down the price, and would frequenly check in on the two. Karter, well versed in the Ironwood trade, worked for Burrowbard at one of his Ironwood export docks.
