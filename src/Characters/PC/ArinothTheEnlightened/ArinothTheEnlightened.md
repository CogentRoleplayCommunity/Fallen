## Backstory

Arinoth the Enlightened was born in a jungle village. When Arinoth was a young boy, he went out into the jungle to gather food for his community. When he returned, his village was gone. The people and the trees were burnt to the ground. Arinoth suspects a dragon attacked that day, but he can’t say for sure. He will never have that certainty to comfort him.

After leaving his village to start a new life, Arinoth was adopted by monks who incited his desire to find his family and grow strong together again. From them, Arinoth has learned to calm his wild monkey mind and focus on his goals. Arinoth has left the monks to live a more independent life. He has found himself trying out for The Order of Silver to find and take revenge on whatever beast brutally destroyed his livelihood.
