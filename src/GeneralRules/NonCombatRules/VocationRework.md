# Vocation Rework

Unlike base cogent, vocations now act as non-combat vocational skill. For instance, if your Vocation was "Chef", you would no longer spend skill points to to unlock the "Cooking" vocational skill. Instead, you would just use your "Chef" dice pool for any cookinging specific tasks.

You can never use a vocation roll as a combat roll, instead you would use a vocational combat skill, such as magic or weapon vocational skills. For our "Chef" example, while they couldn't attack with "Chef", they could have a combat vocational skill of "Small Blade" representing their experience with a cooking knife.

You may still assist any other roll with your vocation if it makes narrative sense.
