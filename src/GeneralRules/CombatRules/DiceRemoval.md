# Dice Removal

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool (often done after taking an injury), always remove the lowest sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

## Keep your Combat Rolls!

Combat Rolls, Dodge Rolls, Assists Rolls, etc... should be held onto during combat. This is to remember your current victory levels for the round. This is also in case your character loses dice due to injury or they gain disadvantage in that round which turn, which will be taken out of your already rolled dice pool.

## Removing Dice to an already rolled Dice Pool

Whenever losing dice of the same kind, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if they dice they lost that round punishes or benifits their combat roll for that round. With physical dice, you can just straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order.
