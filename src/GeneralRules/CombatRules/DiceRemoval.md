# Dice Removal

## Keep your Combat Rolls

Combat Rolls and Evasion Rolls should be held onto during combat. This is to remember your current victory levels for the round. This is also in case your character loses dice (injury, stagger, prone, ectâ€¦) in that round, which will be taken out of your already rolled dice pool.

## Removing Dice

Whenever you are removing dice from a dice pool, always remove the lowest sided dice first. For instance, d4 dice are always removed first, then d6, and so on.

Whenever losing dice of the same kind, always remove dice from left to right. This is to leave it up to chance if they dice they lost that round punishes or benifits their combat roll for that round. With physical dice, you can just straighten out the dice and begin removing in that order
