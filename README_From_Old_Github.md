- 3 Prebuilt Magic systems (Fellcraft, Runecraft, and Miracles) covering traditional Sorcery, Wizardry, and Cleric Stuff. Traditional DnD spells that can scale the user's skill.
- Magic system template that could be ported to any game. Including Cantrips, AOE, Cones, Mutliattack, Single Shot, resource consumption, various ranges, armor penetration scaling.
- A redux of Strength skills that are more realistic and fun imo.
- A redux of Intelligence skills that are more realistic and fun imo.
- Battle map rules for combat

In addition, if you do intend to use "Fallen" as a whole, here is what I hope to provide.
- An interesting world to ground your story in.
- A badass but balanced magic system that encourages creative roleplay (Fellcraft, Miracles, Runecraft).
- Interesting races with the option for players to invent their own races!

- I have done my best to maintain the philosophy of K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid) throughout this document. No complexity for complexities sake.

# Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Shad, Dave, Jazza, and anyone else behind the scenes for their work on Cogent Roleplay. Your hard work allowed me to finally bring my own world "Fallen" to life and share it with my friends. I'm very grateful.

# World Lore

## The Awakening of Fellkind

On dead world, at the end of time, life begins once again…

This world, known as Terra, revolves around a faded and dying star. Once, it was a flourishing world teeming with consciousness and vibrant life. However, it has now become a fallen apocalyptic realm, where only malevolent creatures roam. Their ceaseless hunt driven by the hunger for the conscious life that has long since vanished into oblivion. It drifts ceaselessly through the vast expanse of space, an eternal voyage through boundless void and darkness.

However, a turning point emerged when a celestial entity, known as "the Bright Lord," descended upon Terra, accompanied by other ethereal beings referred to as the Brights or gods in various cultures. Moved by the plight of the mindless monstrosities that roamed the planet, the Bright Lord felt compassion for this lifeless realm. With a benevolent touch, he granted consciousness to those creatures that bowed before him, bestowing upon them the humanoid form akin to his own. This pivotal event came to be known as "The Awakening."

To aid the newly awakened beings in their struggle to survive and thrive in this harsh new world, each of the Brights imparted a unique aspect of themselves. These guiding principles, known as the Tenets of the Awakening, became the foundations upon which Fellkind would navigate their existence:

The Beautiful One declared, "Thou has been given the passion of flesh to spread across the land."

The Ravenous One commanded, "Thou shall indulge and consume of the world that I have granted."

The Bargainer proclaimed, "Thou shall seek prosperity in the wealth and secrets of the land."

The Bound One decreed, "Thou shall go without care for the opinions of the world."

The Faithful One vowed, "Thou shall take up arms and seek righteous vengeance upon those who have betrayed and wronged you."

The Twisting One affirmed, "Thou shall recognize the success of one's neighbor and strive to attain greatness for oneself."

And finally, the Bright Lord himself spoke, "Thou are created in the image of greatness, and shall seek strength, knowledge, and greatness to be closer to I, but shall recognize thine greatness is from within thine own labors."

Through this transformative event, a multitude of beings came into existence. The Bright Lord named these being "Fellkin", as they were of a fallen world. Despite assuming humanoid forms, Fellkind retained the ability to tap into the genetic traits inherited from their monstrous origins. Fellkind learned to harness ichor, the potential energy held in the blood of monsters and Fellkind alike. As the gifted and disciplined among them delved deeper into their newfound powers, they shaped and refined these abilities, giving birth to what is now recognized as Fellcraft.

## The First of Brightkind

With a divine touch, the Bright Lord bestowed the blessing upon the most devoted daughters of Fellkind his offspring.These were the first demi-brights or Brightkind. The Bright Lord proclaimed their rightful dominion over Terra and Fellkind to his offspring, though they would have to seize their claim through their own endeavors. Unlike their Fellkind brethren, Brightkind bore no trace of monstrous traits. They possessed the extraordinary ability to perform Miracles, akin to the Bright Lord himself. While Fellcraft adhered to the natural laws of the world, Miracles appeared to regard them as mere suggestions, perplexing scholars to this very day. Immortality coursed through the veins of Brightkin, much like their celestial progenitor, rendering them virtually impervious to permanent demise.

## Brightinism

The Bright Lord imparted his teachings upon both Fellkind and Brightkind, establishing a spiritual path known as Brightinism. Central to this belief system was the solemn warning of the Dead God, an ancient entity responsible for the forsaken state and cataclysmic demise of the previous world. The Bright Lord strictly forbade the worship of the Dead God, for it was prophesied that such reverence would summon the entity back into existence, triggering another devastating rapture. In order to guide his devoted followers, the Bright Lord bestowed upon them profound visions, serving as beacons of enlightenment and direction for his Brightinist followers.

## The Faithful One

The Bright Lord entrusted the protection of the people of Terra to his most loyal companion, the bright Amon, known as the Faithful One and the bearer of the Mark of the Undying. Amon developed a deep affection for Fellkind, teaching them to defend themselves and dwelled among them. When the remaining demons on the planet began preying upon Fellkind, Amon embarked on a relentless war against them. Wielding the formidable Spear of Destiny, he waged a campaign of rampage and pursuit, extinguishing the existence of demons from Terra.

However, unsatisfied with the mere possibility of their return, Amon ventured to the very realm of the demons. There, he unleashed unyielding fury, tearing through their world with unrestrained might. Legends speak of Amon's boundless rage echoing across the demon realm for an eternity, all driven by his unwavering commitment to protecting those he cherished. The demons, recognizing his indomitable power, bestowed upon him the title of "The Demon of the West," for in time they considered him one of their own. Yet, upon his return, Amon had been forever changed.

From that moment forward, the demons never dared to set foot on Terra again, for the sole object of their terror was none other than Amon himself.

## The Great Betrayal

The motives behind Amon, the Faithful One, attempting to overthrow the Bright Lord remain shrouded in uncertainty. Some believe that he was tainted by the influence of the Dead God, while Brightinist priests often assert that it was a manifestation of the Tenets themselves and a deliberate test of the Bright Lord's will. According to tales passed down through generations, their epic clash was so cataclysmic that it fractured the moon into two distinct celestial bodies.

Ultimately, Amon met his defeat and was imprisoned. In the wake of this treacherous act, the Bright Lord decreed that henceforth, Amon would be forever referred to as "The Great Betrayer." This significant event became known as "The Great Betrayal." In the aftermath, the Bright Lord imparted upon his followers the Tenets of Fear, further shaping their beliefs and guiding their path in the world.

- _"Fear the return of the Dead God"_
- _"Fear the indelible mark of the Undying"_
- _"Fear all tyrants, for true freedom should know no bounds"_

## The Ascension of the Bright Lord

Devoid of light, the people of Terra suffered immensely to the horrors that lurk in the endless darkness . And so, after the Great Betrayal, the Bright Lord ascended to the heavens. High above, the Bright Lord took upon himself the eternal task of tending to the heart of the dying star, infusing it with his own vitality and radiance. From this celestial vantage point, the Bright Lord keeps a vigilant eye over his beloved creations, ever watchful and protective.

As the Bright Lord ascended, the remaining Brights on Terra established their own sects within the realm of Brightinism. This diversification led many individuals to embrace the role of priest among priests, pursuing a sacred path of devotion and guidance.

The remaining Brights established their own sects under Brightinism, leading many to walk the path of priest of priests.

## The Dark Age

Thus commenced the Dark Age, an era spanning 10,000 years during which Fellkin and Brightkin fought a relentless battle against the monstrous inhabitants of the planet. With sheer determination and the strength of their own blood and steel, they painstakingly carved out civilizations. These were times cloaked in darkness, where kingdoms succumbed to the perils of monsters, diseases, internal strife and each other. Eventually, the Dawn Empire emerged as the dominant power, with its resplendent capital, Crossroad, standing at the heart of the continent. From this mighty seat of power, they asserted their control, compelling the kingdoms of Terra to bow before them or face their furious wrath.

## The Dawn Age

And so dawned the Age of Dawn, an epoch characterized by a semblance of peace and prosperity. Under the rule of Brightkin Emperor Commudus Lightbringer, the realm experienced a period of relative tranquility.

# The Bright Pantheon

Brights are a group of beings that are most commonly associated with the Bright Lord himself. The term Bright, should not be seen as an indication of the luminosity of the beings, but rather their association with the Bright Lord. In some cultures around Terra, Brights are also referred to as gods.

## The Bright Lord

Aspect: Light, Intelligence, Dominion

Tenet: “Thou are created in the image of greatness, and shall seek strength, knowledge, and greatness to be closer to I, but shall recognize thine greatness is from within thine own labors.”

Aliases:  King of the Brights, The Star of Dawn

Relics:

- Adversary
- The Crown of Thorns

Lore:
<br>The Bright Lord is the chief deity of Brightinism. As the creator of Fellkind and Brightkind, he is worshiped widely across Terra.

## The Great Betrayer

Domain: Vengeance, Fury, Betrayal

Tenet: “Thou shall take up arms and seek righteous vengeance upon those that have wronged you.”

Aliases: Amon (This name is frowned upon, it is considered heresy and a curse), The Faithful One, Demon of the West, Spear of the Brights

Lore:

The Great Betrayer, known as Amon the Faithful One prior to the cataclysmic event that forever tainted his name, stood as the Bright Lord's most loyal servant. Bestowed with the Spear of Destiny by his master, Amon faithfully served the Bright Lord until his dramatic and sudden betrayal.

The name "Amon" has since become a curse, a foreboding omen not to be uttered lightly. Today, he is widely referred to as "The Great Betrayer" on Terra, with worship strictly forbidden. However, many temples still preserve teachings and house statues of Amon, acknowledging his enduring status within the Bright Pantheon.

By all accounts, Amon was considered the most dangerous of all the Brights, owing to his mysterious ability to adapt his power to match any adversary before him. Scholars are perplexed by the abundance of ancient records chronicling his time living among and protecting the early Fellkind. Some texts even describe him as sharing similarities in stature and strength with Fellkind. Myths recount his legendary battles against the Demon Lords of Terra, depicting him as an unstoppable force of relentless might.

Amon's Mark, known as "the Mark/Brand of the Undying," is referenced in numerous ancient texts. While the exact nature of this mark remains elusive, it is believed to render Amon virtually invincible, endowing him with great power.

Amon's profound affinity for weaponry and equipment is evident, as he is credited with teaching our ancestors the use of many weapons still employed today. Artifacts associated with Amon are closely guarded within the capital of the Dawn Empire, Crossroads. However, whispers persist of lost artifacts, swallowed by the tides of time...

The Twisting One, known by different names across various cultures, such as the "World Serpent" in the Isles of Crest, the "Ouroboros" in Leodelphia, and the "Leviathan" of Redwall, represents a singular entity of immense proportions. It is said to encircle the foundations of the world, predating even the arrival of the Bright Lord. Revered for symbolizing want, growth, and change, the Twisting One is worshiped by the Seakin, Saliours, and those seeking radical transformations in their lives.

Legend speaks of the Bright Lord bestowing wings upon certain offspring of the Twisting One, which gave rise to the first dragons.

The massive movements of the Twisting One deep beneath the ocean's surface are believed to give rise to phenomena such as dry storms and oceanic currents. It is even theorized that earthquakes and fissures on Terra are the result of its movements along the seafloor, leaving gargantuan gashes in the bedrock itself.

Its impenetrable scales are said to render it impervious to physical weapons. Remarkably, a scale from the Twisting One has been discovered deep within the Earth, painstakingly harvested to forge exceptional armor and weapons. These scaled artifacts are said to grant longevity and vitality to their wielders.

Description:
Eyewitness accounts of the Twisting One's immense body, as known in the Dawn Empire, are plentiful. Many mistakenly perceive parts of its body as islands or landmasses.

Dark and colossal scales cover every inch of the creature, rendering it practically indestructible. While sightings of its body parts are relatively common, encounters with its head are rare due to its gargantuan size. Survivors who have witnessed its head describe it as eclipsing the sun itself. Its eyes emit a red glow reminiscent of dawn's rays, while smoke billows from its nostrils, occasionally igniting with bursts of light. Direct eye contact with the creature is said to petrify onlookers, and it exhales storms of fire.

# Other Deities

## The Moon Presence

Many inhabitants of Terra hold reverence for the Moon Presence, considering it a primal force that predates even the arrival of the Bright Lord. Legends speak of a time when the Moon Presence was whole, but during the Great Betrayal, the epic clash between Amon and the Bright Lord caused the moon to fracture, splitting it into two separate entities.

The Old One

The larger of the two moons that grace the skies of Terra. Filled with anger and resentment due to its separation from its other half, the Old One is believed to harbor animosity toward the Bright Lord and his followers.

The Younger

The smaller of the two moons that adorn the celestial expanse of Terra. Revered as the gentler aspect of the Moon Presence, the Younger moon is associated with benevolent influences, such as guiding sailors safely home, ensuring the well-being of pregnant mothers, and bringing forth gentle tides.

# Terra

## The Sun of Terra

The radiant Sun of Terra exhibits a mesmerizing cycle of colors. It initiates its celestial journey with a gentle warmth, casting a luminous yellowish glow upon the land. As the cycle progresses, the Sun transitions into captivating shades of orange and red, illuminating the sky with an enchanting radiance. Gradually, it grows in size, commanding a more prominent presence above Terra. At the culmination of its cycle, a magnificent burst of light emanates, drawing the star back together and restoring its initial warm yellow hue. Although the exact duration of this cycle varies, it typically occurs every 3-5 months.

## The Continent

The sprawling Continent stretches across the vast expanse of Terra, its colossal size dominating a large portion of the planet. Legend speaks of the Brights, in their valiant conquest of Terra, harnessing the power of mighty magma dragons and formidable wyrms dwelling deep within the planet's tectonic plates. These creatures, brought under the control of the Brights, played a pivotal role in unifying the fragmented landmasses of Terra, forging a cohesive and interconnected continent. Their subjugation became a testament to the indomitable spirit and dominion of the Brights over the sprawling lands they sought to conquer.

# Countries of Terra

## The Dawn Empire

Atop the hierarchy of nations on the continent stands the Dawn Empire, a formidable superpower governed by the illustrious Lightbringer Imperial family. With its immense influence and military might, the Dawn Empire holds the mantle of unrivaled power in the region, commanding respect and shaping the course of history.

As the core around which the city thrives, the Tower of the Bright Lord symbolizes the empire's unwavering devotion to the ideals and dominion of the Bright Lord.

## Reddland

### A History of Conquest and Resilience

During the Dark Ages, the vast realm now known as Reddland was under the iron grip of a formidable Siren dynasty, led by the infamous Witch Queen Alana. Revered for her mastery of Runecraft and Fellcraft, Alana's unnaturally extended lifespan testified to her involvement in dark rituals and her insatiable thirst for power. The Witch Queen's dominion began with the assassination of the Chitkin Queen of Caraus, where she seized control over the Chitinkin population, bending them to her will. Her unstoppable army of mentally enslaved Chitinkin and Siren loyalist advanced eastward, subjugating vast territories that now form the heart of Reddland. However, the rugged and defiant Crimson Foothills, inhabited by nomadic tribes and city states of Dhampires, proved to be an unconquerable land.

In this enduring stalemate, a pivotal figure emerged. A young Centurion of the Dawn Empire named Serana Reddinton, a former slave and personal attendant of the Witch Queen, defected from the Dawn Empire Legion and embarked on a perilous mission to liberate her people. Denied military aid by the empire, Serana journeyed to the Crimson Foothills, where she rallied the scattered tribes and city states of her Dhampire kin against their common oppressor. Against all odds, she led her army, known as the Redd Legion, to numerous victories, shattering the Witch Queen's forces time and again. The ultimate triumph came as Serana orchestrated a daring covert operation, infiltrating Tearstone Castle, the Witch Queen's capital, while her forces besieged the city. In a fierce and treacherous battle, Serana emerged as the sole survivor, dealing the final blow to the Witch Queen's reign.

In the wake of this hard-fought victory, the people of Reddland acclaimed Serana as their rightful ruler, establishing a new era for the land. To secure peace and stability, Serana humbly pledged allegiance to the Dawn Empire, earning a seat within the imperial senate and favorable terms for Reddland. The nation prospered, thanks to flourishing trade, renowned magical and medical institutions, a formidable naval fleet, and the Redd Legion, renowned as one of the finest military forces in the world. Reddland's prominence and power became undeniable, solidifying its position as one of the most influential countries on the continent.

In recent years, Reddland has been marked by remarkable advancements in medicine, thanks to the brilliant Veronica Reddland, the current ruler and a visionary leader. Encompassing a significant portion of the eastern edge of the continent, Reddland's population is predominantly composed of Dhampires, reflecting their enduring heritage and cultural dominance within the realm.

### The Laughing Storm

Captain Flint Storm, the Laughing Storm, was an illegitimate child of a noble vampire house called the Daywalkers, hailing from the renowned city of Crossroads. As a pirate, he encountered Victoria Reddington's vessel and, unexpectedly, fell deeply in love with her. Moved by this affection, Flint released her ship along with all its cargo.

### The Redd Blasphemy  

Lord Maxwell Reddington, the designated successor of House Reddington and the Kingdom of Redland, shared his sister Veronica's scholarly pursuits as an academic of Byrgenwerth. Fascinated by the ancient Siren culture that once thrived in Redwall, Maxwell dedicated his time and resources, including his dowry, to funding expeditions into the catacombs that now lay beneath Redwall's foundations. Accompanied by his younger sister, Lady Veronica Reddington, Maxwell embarked on one such expedition, which led them to a remarkable discovery deep within the catacombs. Maxwell returned with a sword of great significance, while Veronica went on to pioneer the development of the first healing bloods of Redwall.

However, following that pivotal day, Maxwell's path took a divergent turn as he became a devout worshipper of the Moon Presence. During a diplomatic mission to Crossroads alongside Veronica, Maxwell experienced a visible mental breakdown. In the presence of the Emperor, he unleashed a torrent of ravings and blasphemies against the Bright Lord, resulting in his condemnation for heresy and a sentence of death. Veronica, held captive as a hostage, nearly ignited a full-scale war between Redland and the Empire. Fortunately, a notorious outlaw pirate lord known as the Laughing Storm intervened by blockading the Iris Sea, issuing a solemn promise to bring chaos and devastation to all vessels until Veronica was safely released.

Ultimately, peace prevailed between the two powers, but it came at a cost. As Veronica was unable to bear children, a binding agreement was reached that the next heir of Redwall would be wedded to the future heir of the Dawn Empire, thereby uniting the countries through blood. This momentous event would later be referred to as "The Redd Blasphemy."

The Laughing Storm, renowned as one of history's most formidable pirate lords and outlaws, willingly surrendered himself to the Reddland navy. Initially condemned to death, he was pardoned by Lady Veronica Reddington in gratitude for his instrumental role in her rescue. However, he remained indebted and obliged to serve Lady Veronica for the remainder of his life. The enigmatic figure known as Flint Storm, also referred to as the Laughing Storm, faithfully served as Veronica's trusted advisor and the Warden of the Sea until their unexpected marriage.

Veronica and Flint attempted to conceive children, but tragedy repeatedly struck. After years of trying, Veronica finally gave birth to an sickly heir, a daughter whose hair bore the ethereal shade of pure white, reminiscent of the full moons that adorned the sky.

In accordance with the pact resulting from the "The Redd Blasphemy", Vex'halia Reddington would eventually be expected to marry Luc Lightbringer, heir to the Dawn Empire, unifying the two kingdoms in blood upon their wedding.

### The Tragedy of Killroy the Fool

The legend of Killroy the Fool echoes throughout Reddland, encapsulating the events of the Redd Revolution and the humble fool who played a significant role in it. Over time, the name Killroy has become synonymous with ill fortune, leading many to shun its usage.

"Once upon a time, in the now-land of Reddland, the tyrannical Siren Witch Queen Alana ruled with an iron grip, using her malevolent magic to control the minds of her subjects.

During that era, the Siren's worship of the Moon Presence was viewed as heresy by the followers of Brightinist faith across the land of Terra. Serana Reddington, a devout Dhampir centurion serving in the Dawn Empire Legion, fervently sought the Emperor's blessing to liberate the lands from the clutches of the Witch Queen Alana. Although the Emperor granted her his approval, he provided no additional forces for the conquest, believing that if the oppressed people themselves did not rise up for their freedom, they did not deserve it.

Returning to the Crimson Foothills, a region constantly besieged by the Witch Queen and her Siren forces, Serana galvanized her fellow Dhampir kin. Blessed with natural leadership skills, she became their beacon of hope, inspiring them to form the Redd Legion in her honor.

Amidst the enduring conflict between Dhampires and their Siren oppressors, war loomed inevitable. Among the recruits who joined the ranks of the Redd Legion was a young Dhampir peasant named Killroy. Despite his humble upbringing, Killroy was renowned for his quick wit, striking looks, exceptional combat skills, and remarkable proficiency in Fellcraft. He yearned to etch his name into the annals of history, aspiring to become a legend, and the impending war presented him with an opportunity to achieve glory.

During a grand feast held in honor of General Serana Reddington, Killroy audaciously challenged her to a duel. If he emerged victorious, he would lead the Redd Legion into battle. However, if he failed, Serana had the right to execute him on the spot. In Killroy's mind, Serana was just another pampered noble of whom he had bested on numerous occasions before, and this time would be no different. Serana, amused by the proposal, accepted the challenge. Thus, blades clashed, Fellcraft were cast, and blood was spilled. In the end, Serana emerged as the victor, and a defeated Killroy closed his eyes, accepting his fate. But instead of the swoosh of a blade, all he heard was laughter. Rising from the ground, he surveyed the chuckling crowd. Amidst her laughter, Serana revealed what she had just declared to the onlookers.

"That was a bold yet foolish plan. However, it seems I have misplaced my court fool. So, instead of death, you shall be my fool."

And thus, Killroy's torment began as Serana's court fool. Donning ridiculous attire, he remained ever close to Serana, be it in camp or on the battlefield. On the eve of the legendary "Battle of the Wet Dress," Killroy made a sarcastic remark about Serana's feast attire. Consequently, clad in Serana's vibrant red dress, Killroy led the charge across the shallow Lunar River the following morning. It is said that the enemy general, upon witnessing Killroy's daring charge, dropped his telescope in the mud, convinced that he had lost his sanity, resulting in him reliquenshing his command. Throughout the war, Killroy distinguished himself, often serving as Serana's second in command and personal bodyguard on the battlefield, for Serana always fought where the danger was greatest. The bond between the two grew inseparable, both in times of war and in moments of respite.

The war was relentless and brutal, but Serana's unwavering leadership became the deciding factor. The Redd Legion pushed deep into enemy territory, laying siege to the capital of the Witch Queen. During the siege, Serana, Killroy, and a select group of elite soldiers embarked on a covert mission to eliminate the Witch Queen once and for all, severing the head of the oppressive serpent.

Little did they know, the Witch Queen Alana, a master of forbidden runecraft, had crafted a ring with the intent to bring an end to the war and all future conflicts. Into this small blue ring, known as "The Singing Ring," she channeled her cruelty, malice, and unyielding desire for dominion. The ring faintly echoed a Siren lullaby, empowering the Witch Queen's mindcraft to unparalleled heights. As they ventured deeper into the capital, their comrades succumbed to fear, abandoning the mission and leaving only Killroy and Serana to face the treacherous final encounter.

The details of the ensuing battle remain shrouded in mystery, but when the Redd Legion eventually triumphed over the castle, they discovered the decapitated body of the Witch Queen Alana. Serana was found cradling the lifeless form of Killroy the Fool, her loyal companion who had stood by her side until the very end, his chest pierced by Serana's own sword. When questioned about the events that transpired, Serana offered no words, choosing to spend the night alone with Killroy's body in the solemn throne room. Come morning, clutching the head of the blasphemous Witch Queen, Serana declared victory in what is now known as Serana Square within the walls of Reddwall.

News swiftly reached Crossroads, carrying the Emperor's decree that legitimized Serana's right to rule the newly founded land of Reddland, albeit as a member of the Empire. Thus, Reddland came into existence, born from the sacrifices and triumphs of its valiant heroes.

Serana, forever changed by her harrowing battle with the Witch Queen, bore the weight of the years, her youthful energy replaced by the demeanor of someone twice her age. Her first act as ruler was to implement laws banning mind control through mindcraft, and the coerced consumption of unwilling Fellin blood. She extended peace to the remaining Siren population, promising an end to the bloodshed and a chance for peace.

The position of Fool transformed into a revered title within Reddland, an honor bestowed posthumously upon those who had laid down their lives in acts of great valor to protect their comrades. Under Serana's reign, Reddland flourished, and an era of peace descended upon the land. Killroy, the once-forgotten fool, achieved the legendary status he had sought, forever etched into the annals of history.

And so, the tale concludes."

The story served as a testament to the power of loyalty, sacrifice, and the enduring spirit of those who strive to shape their destiny amidst the tides of war and destiny.

### Tentcity

Located in the southern region of Reddland, Tentcity sprawls across the Everflow River Delta, a realm governed by House Roseblood. As the last descendants of the fabled Siren Witch Queen Alana, their noble lineage resides in the shadow of the illustrious Siren dynasty of yore.

The Sirens, masters of hydrocraft and the water manipulation runecraft, have harnessed their abilities to shape the river delta into a network of waterways that replace conventional streets. Consequently, much of the city's transportation revolves around the use of small boats, deftly navigating these intricate aquatic pathways.

Within the cityscape, thousands of colossal structures resembling tents stand tall, rivaling the size of buildings. While the Sirens possess extraordinary control over water, the unpredictable nature of the sea occasionally disrupts their plans. Consequently, the denizens of Tentcity must remain vigilant, heeding the predictions of the tide masters and relocating their tented abodes in accordance with the ever-shifting tides.

Amidst this tapestry of tents, one can find ancient blue stone structures interspersed throughout. These magnificent edifices trace their origins back to the time of the Witch Queen Alana. It was she who commissioned the construction of this city as a testament to her power upon emerging from the ocean depths with her formidable army. Crafted from exquisite blue, green, and purple marbles reminiscent of the structures that once graced the land where Redwall now stands, these resilient buildings withstand the sea's wrath while harboring sanctuaries of air-tight chambers within. Regrettably, the art of ancient Siren construction was lost during the upheaval of the "Redd Revolution" and the subsequent defeat of the Witch Queen.

At the southern edge of the Delta stands the grandest of these structures, known as "Castle Pitchtent." Its core structure boasts ancient craftsmanship, enabling it to endure the relentless tides. Over the years, various additions in the form of complex collapsible tent-like structures have been integrated, blending tradition with innovation.

Submerged beneath the watery depths lies the enigmatic Wet District, an ethereal realm solely inhabited by Sirens or those gifted with the ability to breathe underwater. This district, though considered of lower social standing, harbors a breeding ground for crime and smuggling, its depths shrouded in secrets.

Tentcity thrives on its principal exports. From the expansive sea, a wealth of marine products grace its markets, captivating the senses of distant shores. Additionally, stone and rock extracted from the upstream reaches near Rock Shatter Fort contribute to the city's economic prosperity, offering valuable resources hewn from the banks of the Everflow River.

## The Isles of Crest

The Isles of Crest are governed by a loose coalition of Beastkin tribes, each holding territorial control over different parts of the various isles. Annually, the leaders of these tribes gather at Starfall, the largest city in the Crest Isles, which was built around a fallen star revered as sacred by the Beastkin. This assembly serves as a forum to discuss matters of trade, defense, and elect a representative who will serve as a senator, representing their collective interests in the Imperial senate.

The islanders tend to keep to themselves, although encounters with young groups of mercenaries from the isles are not uncommon. These aspiring warriors seek to prove their mettle in battle, driven by the pursuit of glory and wealth.

### Cambria

A year and a half ago, Cambria suffered one of the most severe shard epidemics in recorded history. A coordinated group of sentient monsters descended upon the town during twilight. Out of the 585 residents, only two lost their lives, while the remaining inhabitants were subjected to a fate far worse than death. The entire population of the town was infected with shards, prompting the intervention of the Inquisition of the Dawn Empire. From that point on, Cambria was placed under constant surveillance, and each resident was provided with a hearthstone, a simple enchantment that would alert the authorities upon their demise.

It was expected that all the residents, except for a brother and sister, would succumb to the shards within the first year.

## Uskal

In the far southern reaches, one can find the harsh and unforgiving Uskal Colonies. These colonies were established during the Dark Age when the demand for silver was high in the ongoing battle against the wild monsters that littered Terra. Beneath the icy surface of Uskal, valuable silver and other precious resources were discovered.

The Dawn Empire, in need of silver for their war efforts against the monsters of Terra and seeking a place to dispose of undesirables, offered mudbloods, criminals, and prisoners an alternative to execution. Many individuals seized this opportunity and were transported to the Uskal Colonies to engage in the arduous work of mining and extracting precious resources.

The first lord of Uskal was Leopold Harkon, cousin to Serana Redguard, the founder of Redwall. As the sixth-born son in his family, Leopold had little prospect of acquiring land or status. Viewing Uskal, despite its harsh and inhospitable nature, as his only chance to gain wealth and prestige, Leopold took charge of the colony and successfully managed it for hundrflux of monsters from the Frozen Tundra. As of now, the young Lord Albert Harkon assumes the role of Warden, follring Uskal to be his family's rightful inheritance. With the support of Reddland and the Dawn Empire's indifference as long as the resource flow remained steady, House Harkon became the new overseers of the Uskalian colonies.
>
In modern times, not much has changed. The frigid climate of Uskal persists, with an unending inowing a tragic mining accident that claimed the lives of his father and older siblings. While his father ruled with an iron fist, Lord Albert is a more compassionate and distant ruler, modeling his laws and governance after his kinsmen in Reddland, who adopt a more progressive stance toward mudbloods. Under his leadership, the burdens and taxes on the people of Uskal have lessened. However, the weight of generations of oppression is not easily forgotten by some...

# Races of Terra

## Brightkin

When the Bright Lord bestowed his divine gift upon the first loyal women of Fellkind, their offspring became Brightkin, also known as Demi-Brights, in the realm of Terra. Regardless of their chosen partners, Brightkin always produce offspring who bear the radiant essence of their lineage. However, the birth of Brightkin children is a rare occurrence, as infertility plagues their people, often requiring couples to wait hundreds of years before conceiving a child.

Brightkin are a resplendent and alluring, with the concept of an unattractive Brightkin being entirely unheard of.

One of the remarkable abilities bestowed upon the Brightkin is their capacity to wield the power of the Bright Lord, known as Miracles. Miracles transcend the boundaries of natural laws, considering them merely suggestions. To perform a Miracle, a Brightkin channels the power of Light through intense emotions or vivid memories, harnessing them to achieve their desired effects. Mastery of Miracles necessitates training and practice in the art of emotional control. While not all Brightkin dedicate themselves to mastering Miracles, they all enjoy the benefits of near-immortality. Following their unnatural demise, as long as a Brightkin possesses an internal reserve of light or their lifeless body is exposed to the rejuvenating rays of sunlight, they will gradually resurrect, basked in a resplendent glow. This process restores their body to its peak condition, healing all wounds.

The Dawn Empire is under the rule of the Imperial family, composed entirely of Brightkin. Their capital city, Crossroads, standing at the heart of the continent. From there, they exercise dominion over the entire continent. While the Legions of Empire wield formidable might, a specialized branch known as "The Inquisition" acts as the Empire's fist, crushing rebellion, the outbreaks of disease, and heritics. Renowned for their intellectual prowess, Brightkin produce some of the finest scholars and keepers of lore on Terra.

Devout followers of the Bright Lord and his pantheon, the Brightkin exhibit fervent worship. Many young Brightkin embark on pilgrimages across Terra, spreading the teachings and message of the radiant deity.

## Dhampires

Dhampires trace their monstrous ancestry from the Vampires that bowed to the Bright Lord. Sunlight is deadly to Vampires, meaning those that stood in front of the Bright Lord surely should have perished…

 While Vampires have a powerful aversion to sunlight, Dhampires are unaffected. Also referred to as “Day Walkers”, their distinctive physical attributes include pointy ears, elongated canines, and their distinctive faintly glowing eyes.

Redland is the largest Dhampire kingdom on the eastern edge of Terra. Reddlanians are a fiercely proud people, ruled by house Reddington. Their standing military, “The Red Legion'' is one of the finest armies on Terra and the recent discovery of Blood Healing has made Redland a key player in global politics.

Redland has become a powerful political player as during the Spore pandemic that ravaged the continent, it was their healing bloods that cured the fungal plague that ravaged the continent.

## Seakin

Seakin or Sirens trace their monstrous ancestry from the sea monsters that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were grafted consciousness and the humaniod form of the Bright Lord.

Distinctive features of Sirens include their fin-like ears, blue or green skin (though other colors exist), and often distinctive natural markings.

Much of Siren culture exists beneath the water, owing to their inherent abilities to breath the water. Siren culture used to dominate much of the eastern part of Terra under the Witch Queen Alana. After her defeat, Siren culture retreated for the most part back to the seas. The largest land-based settlement, Tentcity, lies in the south of what is now modern day Redland, ruled by House Roseblood.

Sirens worship different gods than the pantheon of the Brights, though they share a god in the Twisting One which they refer to as “The Leviathan”. A prominent deity worshiped is the Moon Presences, the Parent and the Child.

## Beastkin

Beastkin

Beastkin or Lycans trace their monstrous ancestry from Werewolves and other Beastial monsters that bowed to the Bright Lord.

Since Beastkin are highly varied and shapeshifters, their appearances can vary wildly. Beastkin that live on the Isles of Crest live day to day with their beastail traits showing such as fur, claws, and beastial facial features. While in Redland, where showing these features openly is considered a social taboo, Beastkin simply have animalistic eyes and slightly larger canines. The extent to which their Beastial feature shows is completely subconscious and has usually formed by early adolescence.

Beastkin exists in many countries across Terra. Leodelphia and The Isles of Crest have a majority Beastkin population.

Leodelphia is mostly inhabited by feline beastkin centered around the capital of Oasis which is weaved into an  ancient jungle.

The Isles of Crest are mainly inhabited by canine beastkin. They are a tribal people and weary of outsiders. The largest city named Starfall is centered around where a falling star crashed in the far past.

## Chitinkin

Chitinkin (or Kiki as they call themselves) trace their ancestry from the ancient insectoid monsters that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were granted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord.

Distinctive features of Chitinkin are their exoskin exteriors and insectoid-like traits.

Most Chitinkin dwell deep within the earth in massive colonies that span the massive underground caverns under the surface of Terra. Their societies are heavily influenced by their biology, with their purpose and job dictated by the needs of the collective.

In each Chitinkin city dwells a queen who has powerful Mindcraft that allows her to influence the wills of the non-royal population.  The majority of the Chitinkin are workers that harvest the vast underground mushroom farms and expand the colony. Those that are born into the royal cast are resistant to the queen's influence. They serve as generals, advisors, dukes, and other jobs that require creativity and  self-will.

The largest of these Colonies in the Hive is located in Caurus. The Chitinkin that live on the outskirts of the colonies devoid of the queen’s influence live hard nomadic lives. They stay far away from the colonies as venturing to close might tempt their minds.

## Dragonkin

Dragonkin trace their monstrous ancestry from the ancient dragons that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were grafted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord.

Distinctive features of Dragonkin include horns, certain scaly sections of their skins, and pointed ears.

Dragonkin are one of the rarest races on Terra, as very few of the ancient dragons bowed to the Bright Lord during the Awakening. Dragons are a proud species and dragonkin seemed to have inherited this trait from their monstrous ancestors. Due to their low population, there is no dragonkin majority country. Instead, they occupy positions of authority in many countries across Terra. They make fine advisors and scholars as their long lives permit the ability to learn thousands of years worth of information.

Dragonkin, much like Brightkin,  appear to have an indefinite lifespan. This appears to be related to the scales across their bodies as upon their removal they begin to age and eventually perish.

Mainy Dragonkin worship the Great Leviathan, as it is said that all dragons came from it. For in a time before the creation of Terra, the Great Leviathan aided the Bright Lord. And thus the Bright Lord bestows wings upon all his descendants.

## Crossbreeds

Crossbreeds trace their monstrous ancestry from the ancient monsters that bowed to the Bright lord. These monsters were grafted consciousness and the form of the Bright Lord. However, due to the dilution and mixing of their ancestral bloodlines, the genetic gifts are lost to them. They are often referred to as mudbloods due to their impure bloodlines.

Some bloodlines become impure in a single generation while others take many generations.

Mudbloods make up a large percentage of the population of Terra. Due to their impure bloodline, they are often of a lower class as many of the aristocratic societies across Terra hold deep seeded prejudice against them. While some rise above the prejudice and obtain wealth, status and fame, most live as mundane farmers and peasants. The only Crossbreeds of aristocratic status were great houses where their bloodlines slowly became impure.

Fellcrafts: None
Life Span: 50 - 100 years

# Languages of Terra

## Babelish

A gift from the Bright Lord to Fellkind after their creation. Seen as the common tongue across most of Terra. Simple and practical, it is used extensively by the common folk.

## Bright-speak

Said to be the language of the Bright Lord and his Brights. A beautiful language that almost sounds like singing. This language is spoken exclusively in the higher echelons of Brightkin society and at the Imperial senate.

## Pirish

A sophisticated language spoken by Dhampires and in upper class society across Redland. It originates from the Vampires that roamed Terra from before the Bright Lord arrived.

## Deep-speak

Spoken by Sea-folk, sailors, and anyone that does business on or near water. A flowing language, which underwater is much more pleasant to the ear

## Primal

Spoken by Lycans across the Isles of Crest and Leodelphia. A sequence of grunt, snarls, and growls. Words don't really exist in it, as it conveys intention more than specific words. Can be used to roughly communicate with wildlife, though poorly.  No written script.

## Kikishi

Spoken by the Chitinkin (Kiki) and across the Underworld (the giant caverns that stretch beneath the surface of Terra). A series of clicks form the basis of the language.

## Draconic

A very rare and ancient language that has existed since before creation. Since Dragonkin are rare, this language is only used amongst themselves. An almost serpentine like language in sound.

## Demonic

Said to be spoken by demons, no record exists of it, only myths.

# Diseases of Terra

## The Spore

The spore is an insidious parasitic fungus that exerts control over the brainstem of its unfortunate victims. Manifesting as a vibrant, luminous whitish-blue fungus, it releases airborne spores into the environment. Inhalation of even a small quantity of these spores leads to death within 1-3 months, while exposure to a significant amount results in rapid demise within a day to just a few minutes.

Once deceased, there follows a peculiar 36-hour hibernation period, after which the deceased individuals awaken and embark on a relentless quest to infect new victims. Over time, the fungus gradually emerges from the decaying host, seeking a high vantage point from which to disperse its spores far and wide.

During their dormant state, these infected individuals are referred to as carriers, serving as unwitting vessels for the propagation of the spore.

## Shards

# Base Mechanics

## Victory Levels

- Victory levels from physical attacks can be reduced equal to the amount of STR a character has per combat. If STR is negative, the level of physical injury is increased by 1.
- Victory levels from non-physical (i.e. mental or spiritual) attacks can be reduced equal to the amount of INT a character has per combat. If INT is negative, the level of mental/spiritual injury is increased by 1.
- Injuries can be reduced by physical/mental/spiritual defense.
- A character is rendered Incapacitated once they’ve taken a summed 5 or above injury dice.
- Any lower victory level outcome can be achieved.

## Level 1 victory

- Minor Injury: –1d6 to all physical based dice checks but will naturally heal over the next few days, or faster if treated actively.
- Stagger: opponent is staggered. This could be sand thrown in a character face, being shoulder checked, or losing their footing. Movement speed is halved while staggered. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier while staggered.
- Close Combat: Enter/exit close combat. The initiator of close combat can release the grapple at any time.  Not available to ranged combat rolls.
- Move: Must be in close combat with the opponent. Move an enemy in a desired direction. Base 10 feet of moving. Each point in STR gains 10 feet. Each point in Lift gains 1.25 feet. If the opponent is small in size the distance is doubled. If the opponent is large in size, half the distance.

## Level 2 victory

- Medium injury: -2d6 to all physical based dice checks and must be treated relatively soon, otherwise further penalties may apply such as infection.
- Disarm: opponent loses their weapon.
- Shove: Shove an enemy in a desired direction. Base 5 feet of shoving. Each point in STR gains 2.5 feet. Each point in Lift gains 1.25 feet. If the opponent is small in size the distance is doubled. If the opponent is large in size, half the distance.

## Level 3 victory

- Serious injury: – 3d6 to all physical based dice checks and the character will die in time if the wound is untreated.
- Trip: Opponent is rendered prone.  -4d6 for one round or until footing is regained. Opponents can not benefit from the Defensive modifier.

## Level 4 Victory

- Fatal injury: – 4d6 to all physical based dice checks, incapacitated, and will die very soon if untreated.
- Dismember: remove an arm or leg, which also gives a Serious Injury to the opponent. Not available to ranged combat rolls unless magic or explosive projectiles are involved.
- Render Unconscious: Opponent is rendered unconscious by head trauma, blood chokes, etc. Opponent receives a Medium Injury.

## Level 5 victory and higher

- Death blow: An instant kill.

## Challenge Levels

|      Task Difficulty      | Challenge Level |
| :-----------------------: | :-------------: |
|        Common Task        |      CL 1       |
|       Uncommon Task       |      CL 2       |

## Battlemap Rules

### Movement

- Each grid of the battle map represents a 5x5 ft square.

| Description                    | Calculation                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Humanoid Combat Movement Speed | 30 ft (Base), +10 ft (per RFX), +5 ft (per Athletics) |
| Flight Combat Speed            | 70 ft (Base), +20 ft (per RFX),+10 ft (per Athletics) |

- If a creature has a negative in RFX then 10 ft is deducted from their total movement movement.
- If a creature has a negative in the Athletics skill then 5 ft is deducted from their total movement movement.

### Size

If there is a difference in size between two creatures who have contested checks where size would be an advantage or disadvantage, the narrator should adapt accordingly.

|   Description   |          Effect           |
| :-------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Tiny Size    | 2.5x2.5 ft on battle map. |
|   Small Size    |   5x5 ft on battle map.   |
|   Medium Size   |   5x5 ft on battle map.   |
|   Large Size    |  10x10 ft on battle map.  |
|    Huge Size    |  15x15 ft on battle map.  |
| Gargantuan Size |  20x20 ft on battle map.  |

### Difficult Terrain

Steep mountains, ice-covered ground, swamps, etc. are difficult terrain. It takes twice the movement to move through these terrains (10 feet instead of 5 feet).

## Destiny Point Rules

### Player vs Player (Optional)

If two players are competing against one another in a dice roll, then destiny points can only be used preemptively. This is to ensure players don't waste all their destiny points fighting each other.

## Core Skills Rules

### Strength Skills Redux

- Lift would be represented by strong men or powerlifters. Covers physical activity related to raw strength, most used in moving or holding heavy objects. Examples include shouldering a door open, carrying or throwing heavy weights, or crushing something in your hands.
- Athletics would be represented by sprinters, high-jumpers, and basketball players. Covers physical activity related to raw speed and jump height. It covers throwing light objects and catching them. Examples include chasing someone, jumping over a pit, throwing a baseball, or dunking a basketball.
- Climb would archetypically be represented by rock climbers. Covers all climbing related activities. Examples include climbing a rock face, descending a rope, holding on for dear life, or swinging between tree branches.
- Swim would be represented by olympic swimmers. Swim covers all situations where characters are attempting to move in liquids. It is also applicable to science fiction settings in Zero gravity environments. Swimming may be more difficult if a character is wearing heavy clothing or resisting conflicts at the same time, at the narrators discretion. If skill points are assigned, narrative failure applies as normal, with your character making no headway, treading water or otherwise. However, if you have not assigned any points into swim, your character slips underwater and begins drowning.
- Endurance would be represented by ultra marathon runners. Endurance is the physical trait that represents your body’s ability to process toxins and resist disease. Resisting food poisoning, hot and cold weather and pushing on past exhaustion are all the domain of endurance.

### Intelligence Skills Redux

- Willpower would be represented by the mental aspects of Navy Seals. Measures a character's mental control, exerted to do something or restrain impulses. This could be to do something gross but necessary, resist being verbally or mentally manipulated/attacked, resist being seduced, hold your cool in a scary situation, etc...
- Communication would be represented by politicians or con men. It is a measure of your verbal and non-verbal social skills. While anyone can try persuading, deceiving, bartering, or seducing, it is the manner in which you communicate that will ultimately entail success or failure. It's not what you say, but how you say it.
- Spiritual skill would be represented by a shaman, psychics, or priests. It is your character's profound intuition about supernatural matters such as souls, life, death, good and evil. It is the gut feeling you get when you enter a decrepit building and feel something terrible has happened there. It also represents the strength of your soul's connection to your physical body and determines your soul's ability to resist spiritual harm.
- General Knowledge  would be represented by a historian or bookworm. General Knowledge is the art of listening to rumors, recalling information and applying it where it is needed most. It aids in many tasks while being very specifically only usable on non-specialized tasks. A general knowledge check could never allow you to know how to disarm a bomb, but it might be able to tell you that to disarm a bomb you need to cut a specific wire. Which wire? You have no idea, perhaps if you had a Vocational Skill related to explosives you might know more.
- Survival would be represented by a survivalist or street smarts. It is the skill associated with staying alive in all environments. It covers scavenging for food, basic first aid as well as finding safe places to rest and lighting fires. In the city, survival keeps you from going too close to dangerous gang territory, it lets you know who to avoid, and where to avoid. In the wilderness, it tells you which berries will make you sick, which meat is spoiled and more.

## Skill Specialty

Once a dice pool for a given skill check is equal to or greater than 8 you are considered a specialist in that skill. If you are a specialist for a skill, when asked to make a check for that skill with a Challenge Level of 3 or less, you automatically pass if all of the following are true.

- You are not under duress (No time pressure, no outside influences or aggression such as combat.)
- The check is not a contested check.
- The check is not a reflexive action.

## Evasion Roll

When an attack is made against a character who is not returning fire or attacking back, the defender can make an Evasion Roll vs the attacker's Combat Roll. Any levels over the defender's Evasion wins count as victories for the attacker. The Evasion Roll counts for the entire round. A Combat Roll and Evasion Roll can both be made in a round. If the character takes the Defensive combat modifier, then it is also applied.

- Evasion Roll = Base dice + RFX + Acrobatics Skill + Defensive modifier (if declared)

## Hardcore Carry Weight

Carry weight represents a character's ability to haul weight while still being able to move semi-normal depending on weight class.
|          Description          |                       Effect                        |
| :---------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| Humaniod Max Inventory Weight | 100 lb (Base), +100 lb (per STR), +20 lb (per Lift) |
|  Light Weight (0% - 24.99%)   |                     100% speed                      |
| Medium Weight (25% - 49.99%)  |               -1d6 STR/RFX, 80% speed               |
|  Heavy Weight (50% - 99.99)   |               -2d6 STR/RFX, 50% speed               |
|  Overencumberd (above 100%)   |               -4d6 STR/RFX, 0% speed                |

## Combat Modifiers

### Dash (2x Movement Speed)

Instead of engaging in a combat roll, a player can choose to focus purely on their movement  in combat, doubling their movement speed. They can make an Evasion Roll. They may not take the Defensive modifier during a dash. While dashing, any attack against you gains the Flank combat modifier, as you are purely focused on movement. (2x Movement Speed)

### Charge (+1d6)

If there is 15 ft between the character and opponent, they may add their momentum to their attack. This must be in a straight line, and once a charge is initiated as a portion of movement, your directions must remain constant the entire round.

### Focused (+1d6)

While making a ranged attack, remain still and  focus on a single shot. Your Engageable Opponents is reduced to 1 for the turn. You can not move while making a focused shot.

### Brace (+2 wins versus charge)

A brace is a move purely to counter a charge. No movement can be used while bracing. Bracing uses the opponent’s momentum against them, enabling a prepared defender to more easily stagger, trip or injure the charging opponent.

### High ground (+2d6)

Bonus received through achieving a height advantage against an opponent, IE standing on a table, riding on a mount etc.

### Flank (+2d6)

Bonus received when attacking an opponent actively engaged in something else, IE exhausting an opponent 's Engagable Opponents within a single round, picking a lock, dashing away, etc.

### Staggered (-2d6)

Penalty received if the opponent selects to stagger through a victory level, or if the Narrator applies it. This could be sand thrown in a character face, being shoulder checked, or they lose their footing. Movement speed is halved while staggered. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier while staggered.

### Close Combat

The fight is so close in physical proximity that the character’s bodies are pressed up against each other in a grapple or wrestle. A character using a medium (or larger) weapon is considered unarmed. Injury reduction from armor is not applicable while in close combat. Medium weapons can be used in close combat against reach weapons.

### Defensive (+2d6) (no victory levels)

This is when a character purely focuses on defending themselves. No victory levels can be achieved for the round by the defender. Applies both to Combat Rolls, and Evasion Rolls if declared. Can not be applied while a player can not fully focus on defending themselves (Staggered, Prone, Flanked, etc.)

### Prone (-4d6)

Penalty lasts for one round or until the character readies themselves. In combat, the penalty counts as taking place during the action of getting up while fighting. The opponent can not benefit from the Defensive modifier if they are trying to regain their footing during the round.

### Effective Range Exceeded (-3d6)

If a ranged shot is being made within it's max range but exceeding it's effective range. The -3d6 penalty is the base penalty, but the narrator is free to adjust this given the context of the shot trying to be made.

### Off guard (CL in lieu of defense roll)

CL determined by Narrator IE, attacking a soldier from behind may require a successful Stealth check, then the attack (which they cannot defend against) will be a CL assigned by the Narrator, which the player will roll against with a normal combat roll (without a flanking bonus). Any wins achieved over the CL counts towards the level of victory. Failing the CL commences the next round of combat, where the opponent is then engaged.

### Incapacitated

If a character is incapacitated, they are held in place, tied up, or unconscious and therefore cannot fight back or defend themselves. Armor levels are disregarded if the attackers can narratively get around the armor easily. The CL a character must exceed to obtain ANY victory level against them is CL1.

### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

#### Half Cover: +2 Defense

A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

#### Three-quarters Cover: +3 Defense

A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

#### Full Cover: Can't be engaged or engage in ranged combat

A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

## Healing

### Minor Healing Factor

Minor injuries heal in one day.
All other injuries heal over the next few days if maintained. Once healed they are downgraded to the injury level below.

### Minor Heal

Removes a minor or lesser injury.
For a higher tier injury, reduce the dice penalty of the  injury by 1. Injury remains at its current tier. Further minor heals have no effect. The higher tier injury requires the appropriate heal tier to completely remove it.

### Medium Heal

Removes a medium or lesser injury.
For a higher tier injury, reduce the dice penalty of the  injury by 2. Injury remains at its current tier. Further medium healing  has no effect. The higher tier injury requires the appropriate heal tier to completely remove it.

### Serious Heal

Removes a serious or lesser injury.
For a higher tier injury, reduce the dice penalty of the  injury by 3. Injury remains at its current tier. Further serious healing has no effect. The higher tier injury requires the appropriate heal tier to completely remove it.
Can be used to reattach limbs as long as the limb is not completely destroyed.

### Superior Heal

Removes a Fatal  or lesser injury.
Can be used to regrow limbs and body parts.

### Revival Heal

Return a dead character to life with a serious injury. Can only be performed within minutes of death.
For living characters, it completely heals all injuries, returning the body to peak performance.

## Mounts in combat

- When a mounted character or their mount takes an injury in combat, a Ride/Pilot check equivalent to the injury level must be succeeded to stay on horseback, else they are knocked off.
- Depending on the character's Ride/Pilot, they get to use a portion of the mount's movement speed instead of their own while mounted, dictated by the table below.

| Ride/Pilot Level | Combat Movement Speed |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 0 skill          | Mount Speed -25 ft    |
| 1 skill          | Mount Speed -15 ft    |
| 2 skill          | Mount Speed -10 ft    |
| 3 skill          | Mount Speed -5 ft     |
| 4 skill          | Mount Speed -0 ft     |

## Weaknesses and Resistances

### Weaknesses

Creatures can be susceptible to certain sources of damage.

|          Description           |                            Effect                             |
| :----------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Minor (damage-type) Weakness  | +1 to the level of injury received from (damage type) damage. |
|  Med. (damage-type) Weakness   | +2 to the level of injury received from (damage type) damage. |
|  Major (damage-type) Weakness  | +3 to the level of injury received from (damage type) damage. |
| Extreme (damage-type) Weakness | +4 to the level of injury received from (damage type) damage. |
| Mortal (damage-type) Weakness  | +5 to the level of injury received from (damage type) damage. |

### Resistances

Creatures can be resistant to certain sources of damage.

|            Description            |                          Effect                          |
| :-------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Minor (damage-type) Resistance   | -1 to victory levels received from (damage type) damage. |
|   Med. (damage-type) Resistance   | -2 to victory levels received from (damage type) damage. |
|  Major (damage-type) Resistance   | -3 to victory levels received from (damage type) damage. |
| Extreme (damage-type) Resistance  | -4 to victory levels received from (damage type) damage. |
| Complete (damage-type) Resistance | -5 to victory levels received from (damage type) damage. |

## Defense

Depending on the damage type, different types of defense can be used to resist injuries. A character can then reduce a physical injury level by the equivalent amount of defense they have for that damage type. The only way to injure an opponent with a specific defense is to exceed, or bypass it.

### Physical Defense

A measure of a character's resistance to all physical injuries. A character can wear two pieces of armor in the same category, such as wearing a gambeson under chainmail or a breastplate, which was most certainly done in history.
In these circumstances the most efficient ways of defeating a person in armor is grappling them or tripping them and holding them down, just like in real life.

- Physical Defense level = sum of all armor’s defense levels rounded down

### Bodily Defense

A measure of a character's resistance to affliction and status effect injuries. Determines your body's ability to handle resisting poisoning, blood clotting, etc. Wins determined by the roll below act as your defense against injury. The wins achieved by this can be reduced by an attacker's attack penetration.

- Bodily Defense = Endurance Roll

### Mental Defense

Mental defense is a measure of a character's bulwark against all mental injuries and influence. Wins determined by the roll below act as your defense against injury. The wins achieved by this can be reduced by an attacker's attack penetration.

- Mental Defense = Willpower Roll

### Spiritual Defense

Spiritual defense is a measure of a character's bulwark against all spiritual injuries and influence.Wins determined by the roll below act as your defense against injury. The wins achieved by this can be reduced by an attacker's attack penetration.

- Spiritual Defense = Spiritual Roll

### Armor Durability and Damage

If an injury is fully negated by armor, then the defender can decide which pieces of armor take armor damage. The armor/armors must sum up to the defense level required to prevent the incoming injury and all take the same amount of armor damage.

- Armor damage = (level of injury delt) + (attack's armor penetration)
If an injury is not fully negated by the defender's armor, then all pieces of armor take armor damage.

### Armor Tiers

| Level | Rune Slot |   Durability/Tier   |
| :---: | :-------: | :-----------------: |
|  -4   |     0     |    0/0 (Broken)     |

|  +8   |     8     |   36/36 (Fabled)    |
|  +9   |     9     |    39/39 (Epic)     |
|  +10  |    10     |  42/42 (Legendary)  |
|  +11  |    11     |   45/45 (Mythic)    |

### Disarming

# Magic

All of Fallen’s 3 magic systems (Fellcraft, Miracles, and Runecraft) are built of the same rule in combat. Instead of listing this out 3 times, it has been consolidated here in one place. Keep in mind the following while reading the pre-made Fallen magic systems listed further below.

- Magic = Fellcraft/Miracles/Runecraft
- Resource = Ichor/Light/Energy
- Cantrip = Trick/Wonder/Sign
- Magic Vocation = Fellkin/Brightkin/Runesmith

## Magic Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Magic skill. A minimum of one Resource is required to make a non-Cantrip Magic Roll. Resources up to the level in the user’s Magic vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Magic Roll for each Resource consumed.

- Magic Skill Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Magic Skill) + Xd6 (STR/RFX/INT) + Xd6 (Resource consumed capped by Magic Vocation)

## Resource

Resource is what is consumed to use magic.

- +3 Resource per Magic Vocation

### Regaining Resource

Depending on your magic system, maintaining one's physical health can restore Resource over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. For instance a short nap might only regain a single point, whereas a long night's rest with a warm meal could restore full Resource. The narrator should give more Resource to characters with a higher Magic Vocation level.

### Absorbing Resource

Depending on your magic system, Magic users can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements/magic/power to regain Resource using a Magic skill. This ability can be used once per day for each Magic Vocation point, resetting on long rests. The magic skill used dictates how much Resource is regained determined by your skill level. If negative or zero, none is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the elements/magic/power are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

### Magic Cantrips

Cantrips are uses of Magic that use an insignificant amount of Resource. In general, Cantrips should be small and happen close to the user. Igniting your fingertips to light a cigar, or creating a gentle breeze are all examples of Cantrips. Cantrips attacks are considered the weakest form of offense, only used in dire situations or for utility.

- Unaffected by Magic assists (as no Resource is consumed)
- Resource Requirement: 0 (No Resource can be used to increase dice)

## Magic Range

The Range type for non cantrip ranged attacks changes depending on the user's skill level.

| Skill level | Range Type   |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| -1          | Close        |
| 0           | Short        |
| 1           | Medium       |
| 2           | Extended     |
| 3           | Long         |
| 4           | Sharpshooter |

### Magic Range adjustment

If a Magic Skill has a range adjustment it is either moved up or down the table above.

For instance if I have a level 3 Magic skill with a -1 Magic Range adjustment,  my magic skill has an Extended Range Type.

### Cone

Represents a character unleashing an attack over an area represented by a cone. The table below shows default cones, with the width of the cone at any point equal to the distance from the user. However, any cone that doesn’t exceed effective range or the Cone Area for a specified dice roll is acceptable.

- Cone Base/Height: Magic Roll * 5 feet

| Magic Roll | Cone Height/Base | Cone Angle  | Cone Area   |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 2 dice     | 10 ft            | ~53 degrees | 50 ft^2     |
| 3 dice     | 15 ft            | ~53 degrees | 112.5 ft^2  |
| 4 dice     | 20 ft            | ~53 degrees | 200 ft^2    |
| 5 dice     | 25 ft            | ~53 degrees | 312.5 ft^2  |
| 6 dice     | 30 ft            | ~53 degrees | 450 ft^2    |
| 7 dice     | 35 ft            | ~53 degrees | 612.5 ft^2  |

| 11 dice    | 55 ft            | ~53 degrees | 1512.5 ft^2 |
| 12 dice    | 60 ft            | ~53 degrees | 1800 ft^2   |

Here is a handy equation I made for calculating custom Cones. “A” is area, “D” is distance, and theta is the angle closest to the caster. Simply plug in the Area for your dice roll, and either “D” or theta. Whatever you didn’t plugin will be calculated. If none of this makes sense, brush up on your trigonometry or just use the default cones above!

# Miracles

When the Bright Lord gave onto the first loyal women of Fellkind his children, the resulting offspring were the first Brightkin of Terra. Brightkin have the ability to use the power of the Brighlord, known as Miracles. Miracles consider the laws of nature a mere suggestion. To perform a Miracle, Light is channeled through specific strong emotion or memories to receive a desired effect.
Miracles require training and practice to use, harnessing one's emotions. Most Brightkin don't devote themselves to mastering Miracles, though they enjoy the benefits of near immortality.

## Miracle Roll

This roll represents your abilities with Miracles. A minimum of one Light is required to make a non-Wonder Miracle Roll. Light up to the level in the user’s Brightkin vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Miracle Roll for each Light consumed.

- Miracles Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Miracle Skill) + Xd6 (STR/RFX/INT) + Xd6 (Light consumed capped by Brightkin Vocation)

## Light

Light is the catalyst for all Miracles. It is channeled through an emotion or memory to produce a desired effect.

- +3 Light per Brightkin Vocation

### Generate Light

All Brightkin have an inner light. Maintaining one's physical health restores Light gradually over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. For instance a short nap might only regain a single point, whereas a long night's rest with a warm meal could restore full Light. The narrator should take into account the Miracles vocation when granting light from rest.

### Absorb Light

Brightkin can absorb Light via ample sources of light (such as the Sun) or by drawing on powerful emotion/memories. The ability can be used once for each Brightkin point, resetting on long rests. The points in the specific Miracle skill used dictates how much Light is regained. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

## Miracle Wonders

Wonders are uses of Miracles that use an insignificant  amount of Light. In general, Wonders should be small and happen close to the user. Making your hand a flashlight, making your eyes grow faintly, or making small illusions are examples of Wonders. Wonders can be used even if the user's Light is completely depleted.

- Unaffected by Brightkin assists (as no Light is consumed)
- Light Requirement: 0 Light (No Light can be used to increase dice)

## Radiance

Radiance users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create light (hard light, illusions, etc...)
- Manipulate light

Users of Radiance focus on the manipulation of light externally. Radiance is extremely versatile and has become a staple of Angland’s way of life.

In warfare, whether it is smiting the enemy from afar, armoring themselves and companions with hard light gear, or creating illusions of calvary charging at the enemies flanks, they are a force to be reckoned with.

### Specialization: Hard Light

Hard light is light that has been formed into a tangible physical material.

- Hard light maintains its form for roughly 1 hour. The user can choose to mimic the density of a certain material.
- The larger and heavier the object, the more difficult to create and maintain. The density and size of the light is a property controlled by the user.
- Hard light objects can be damaged, leaking light and dramatically reducing their duration.
- Hard light objects can be made to have a fixed position, though they will expire dramatically faster depending on the density/weight of the object.
- Once created, a user does not need to stay close to the objects for it to maintain its form.

### Specialization: Illusions

Illusions are created by bending light to create a false image.

- Illusions maintain their form for roughly 1 hour. Users can extend this, but require a harder check.
- Illusions can move, either under control of the user or set to a loop by the user.
- Illusions can not produce sound.

### Absorb Light: Sun Light

Ample sunlight can be used to absorb Light.

### Radiant Resistance

By achieving a CL 3 check, for the cost of 1 Light a character may gain resistance to this element equal to the points invested in this Fellcraft. This effect has a duration of 1 hour.

## Blessing

Users of Blessing can narratively attempt the following:

- Bind light to themselves and others
- Heal themselves and others

While Radiance focuses on the manipulation of external light, Blessing focuses on the manipulation of light within the body. Blessings can be used to enhance or repair physical characteristics.

When the user is under the effect of a Blessing they will begin to glow with wisps of light.

### Buffs

When a character attempts a Blessing Buff on themselves or another, they make a Blessing Roll. Depending on the wins achieved, the user gains that benefit and all the benefits below. If the user attempts to perform another Blessing Buff on themselves, they must drop their Blessing Buff.

### Absorb Light: Emotion

Powerful emotions or memories can be meditated on to regain Light. A user must describe the powerful emotion in detail. If the Narrator agrees the emotion or memory is sufficient, then the user's inner light will surge, regaining Light.

# Fellcraft

The monsters of the Terra are known for their terrifying speed, strength, and strange abilities. They have evolved to achieve this by using the potential energy found in their blood, referred to as Ichor.

Due to their monstrous ancestry, Fellkind carries Ichor in their veins as well. Fellkin are able to express their dormant genes, mimicking the terrifying genetic abilities of their monstrous ancestors. These abilities can often entail rather grotesque restructuring of the user's physiology.

Many of these abilities express themselves in response to extreme stress, which activates dormant genes.

Fellcraft takes training, practice, and study to master. Most Fellkin never follow the path of mastering Fellcraft.

## Fellcraft Roll

This roll represents your abilities with a specific type of Fellcraft. A minimum of one Ichor is required to make a non-Trick Fellcraft Roll. Ichor up to the level in the user’s Fellkin vocation can be consumed, adding an additional d6 to the Fellcraft Roll for each Ichor consumed.

- Fellcraft Roll = 3d6 (base) + Xd6 (Fellcraft Skill) + Xd6 (STR/RFX/INT) + Xd6 (Ichor Consumed capped by Fellkin Vocation)

## Ichor

Ichor is the potential energy found in both monster and Fellkind blood. This energy is responsible for all of Fellcraft.

- +3 Ichor per Fellkin Vocation

### Regaining Ichor

Maintaining one's physical health restores Ichor over time. This can be done by maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels. For instance a short nap might only regain a single point, whereas a long night's rest with a warm meal could restore full Ichor. The narrator should take into account the Fellcraft vocation when granting Ichor from rest.

### Absorbing Ichor

Fellkind can absorb and feed on an ample source of primal elements to regain Ichor. The ability can be used once for each Fellcraft Vocation point, resetting on long rests. The points in the specific Fellcraft skill used dictate how much Ichor is regained. Absorbing or meditating near a large source of the element are acceptable. Flavor and creativity are encouraged.

## Fellcraft Tricks

Tricks are uses of Fellcraft that use an insignificant amount of Ichor. In general, Tricks should be small and happen close to the user. Igniting your fingertips to light a cigar with Blazecraft, stirring a cup of tea with Hydrocraft, or creating a gentle breeze with Galecraft are all examples of Tricks. Trick attacks are considered the weakest form of offense, only used in dire situations or for utility.

- Unaffected by Fellkin assists (as no Ichor is consumed)
- Ichor Requirement: 0 Ichor (No Ichor can be used to increase dice)

Polycraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Take on physical monstrous traits
- Attack with monstrous traits

## Plasmacraft

Plasma and Sunlight can be used to absorb Ichor. 

## Stormcraft

Stormcraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create storms.
- Manipulate storms.
- Control the weather

### Fellcraft Combination:

This Fellcraft can only be accessed by users with a specialization in Galecraft, Hydrocraft, and Electrocraft. The lowest dice total of the required Fellcraft will be used for this Fellcraft.

### Specialization: The Storm Dragon

Every storm on Terra is said to be started by a Storm Dragon, who dwells deep in the eye of the Great Storm at the edge of the world, far away from the continent of Terra.

#### Control Weather
Like the Dragons of the Great Storm, Stormcraft users may manipulate the weather to their liking. How large and furious the weather event determines the check required. A check to increase the ferocity of a storm already in progress should be far easier than if the user tried to do the same with a calm day.

Though if the legend is true and the storms do come from the Great Storm, then it would be wise for one to influence the storms wisely. As surely dragons do not tolerate the interferences of mere mortals.

## Magmacraft

Stormcraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create magma.
- Manipulate magma.
- Melt rock.
- Influence tectonic plates

### Fellcraft Combination:

This Fellcraft can only be accessed by users with a specialization in Blazecraft and Terracraft. The lowest dice total of the required Fellcraft will be used for this Fellcraft.

### Specialization: The Magma Dragon

When the horrors of Terra bowed down before the Bright Lord, the Bright Lord conscripted the Great magma dragons of the world who dwell even deeper than the great underground caverns of Terra in infinite seas of lava. The continents that were once separate were brought together, so that Brighkind may rule over all of their new world.

#### Influence Tectonic Plates

The influence of tectonic plates can result in magma geysers and other geological phenomena. If enough masters of Magmacraft were brought together, Terra itself might shift once again…


## Blizzardcraft

Stormcraft users can narratively attempt the following:

- Create blizzards.
- Manipulate blizzards.

### Fellcraft Combination:

This Fellcraft can only be accessed by users with a specialization in Galecraft and Cryocraft. The lowest dice total of the required Fellcraft will be used for this Fellcraft.

### Specialization: The Blizzard Dragon

In the frigid places of Terra, Blizzard Dragon will bury entire kingdoms in great blizzards to feast on the frozen corpses of the dead. The great blizzards around them act as camouflage to mask their movements.

#### Create Blizzards

Like the Blizzard Dragon, Blizzardcraft users may manipulate the Blizzards to their liking. How large and furious the blizzard determines the check required. A check to increase the ferocity of a blizzard already in progress should be far easier than if the user tried to do the same with a sunny warm day.

## Fellcraft Tree

The only way for Fellkin to obtain new Fellcraft is to emulate the genetic links of the Monsters they originate from.


This tree represents the different path to acquire different Fellcrafts. Each solid line represents a monster whose genes bridge between Fellcrafts. For instance, Vampires represent the links between Hemacraft and Mindcraft as well as Mindcraft and Shadowcraft. While Vampires represent this on the Fellcraft Tree, these genes may exist in other monsters. This tree just shows the natural progression a Fellkin could take to acquire new fellcraft.


Squares represent normal Fellcrafts. These can be accessed if you choose this if your race has access or if you have a neighboring Fellcraft square already at level 1 in that Fellcraft skill. Any newly gained Fellcraft starts at level -1.


Circles represent Fellcraft combinations, which require the Fellcrafts that attach to it in order to use. The level of the combo Fellcraft is equal to the lowest dice roll of the Fellcrafts required.
